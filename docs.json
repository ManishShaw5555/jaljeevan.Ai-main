Aquifers are normally of \nlarger sizes and hence it is recommended to assess the resources in a smaller units called \nassessment units and present the results aquifer wise. A ground water assessment unit is \na geograp",
    "ally of \nlarger sizes and hence it is recommended to assess the resources in a smaller units called \nassessment units and present the results aquifer wise. A ground water assessment unit is \na geographic land area for which ground water assessment is to be carried out with the \nobjective of estimating the following components: \na) Current gross ground water extraction. \nb) Recharge due to  ‘Other Sources’ (These are the sources other than \nrainfall) \nc) Resultant Inflow into the system. \nd) Recharge from rainfall. \ne) Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource. \nf) Current stage of ground water  extraction. \ng) Stage of ground water extraction \nh) Ground Water Table trend. \ni) Categorisation for future ground water development . \nj) Ground Water Allocation for future domestic  water supply. \nk) Net annual ground water availability for future  use. \nl) Additional Potential Resources \nm) In-storage resources \nn) Dynamic and In -storage resources of Confined and semi -Confined \nAquifers \nEach state/Union Territory should adopt a particular type of ground water  assessment \nunit. Ground water assessment is also to be done on the basis of a ground water year. The \ntype of ground water assessment unit and the characteristics of a ground water year which \nare common for all ground water assessment units in a particular State/Union Territory \nare discussed in this chapter. \n1.2 TYPE OF GROUND WATER ASSESSMENT UNIT \nEach State/Union Territory should adopt only one of the following f ive types of ground \nwater assessment unit s for the entire State/Union Territory  depending on the major \nlithology in the state. These are namely: \n2 \n \na) Block \nb) Taluka \nc) Mandal \nd) Firka \ne) Watershed. \nThe first four types mentioned above are administrative in character, and the last one \nnamely, ‘Watershed’ is a hydrologic unit. All States/Union Territories are predominantly \ncharacterised by either ‘Alluvial Aquifer’ or ‘Non Alluvial Aquifer’. The type of unit to \nbe adopted will depend",
    "ely, ‘Watershed’ is a hydrologic unit. All States/Union Territories are predominantly \ncharacterised by either ‘Alluvial Aquifer’ or ‘Non Alluvial Aquifer’. The type of unit to \nbe adopted will depend on the predominant Principal Aquifer a particular State/Union \nTerritory contains. \nNormally in any area, there will be one unconfined aquifer, one or more confined aquifers \nand one/more semi confined aquifers. Presently Aquifer Mapping is going on in the \ncountry on a war footing. In this, entire country is divided into 14 principal aquifers which \nin turn divided into 42 major aquifers. The major aquifers demarcated in the country are \npresented below: \nTABLE 1.

    "ard rock areas and 300m in soft rock \nareas. If disposition of deeper aquifers is not known, resources should be computed as if \nthere exists only a single aquifer and that is in unconfined condition. \nAll St ates/Union Territories which are predominantly characterised by ‘ Non Alluvial \nAquifers’ should adopt ‘Watershed’ as the type of ground water assessment unit. Such \nStates/Union Territories which have been adopting either ‘Block’ or ‘Taluka’ or ‘Mandal’ \nor Firka as the type of ground water assessment unit should switch over to ‘Watershed’ \nas the type of ground water assessment unit for the second national assessment using GEC \n2015 methodology. The reasons for recommending ‘Watershed’ as the type of ground \nwater assessment unit in  the area with Non Alluvial Aquifers are as follows: \na) The undulating topography in the  area of Non -Alluvial Aquifers  allows easy  \ndemarcation of a hydrologic unit like ‘Watershed’. \nb) The boundary of a ‘Watershed’ in Non-Alluvial Aquifer terrain mostly coincides \nwith the ground water divide as a result of which ground water balance within it \ncan be made very conveniently. \nAll States/Union Territories which are predominantly characterised by ‘Alluvial’ aquifers \nshould adopt either ‘Block’ or ‘Taluka’ or ‘Mandal’ or ‘Firka’ as the type of ground water \nassessment unit. A hydrologic unit like a  ‘Watershed’ as the type of ground water \nassessment unit is not recommended in the ‘Alluvial’ aquifers for the following reasons. \n5 \n \na) Demarcation of the  boundaries of the ‘Watershed’ in ‘Alluvial’ aquifers is \ndifficult because of the relative flatness of the alluvial areas. \nb) The boundary of a ‘Watershed’ in ‘Alluvial’ aquifers will not usually coincide \nwith the ground water divide, as a result of which there is no particular advantage \nof adopting ‘Watershed’ as the type of ground water assessment unit. \n1.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUND WATER YEAR \n1.3.1 GROUND WATER YEAR \nIndia receives rainfall from both South -West and",
    "r advantage \nof adopting ‘Watershed’ as the type of ground water assessment unit. \n1.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUND WATER YEAR \n1.3.1 GROUND WATER YEAR \nIndia receives rainfall from both South -West and North -East monsoons. The former is \nmore or less consistently active during June to August, and the latter is more or less \nconsistently active during October and November. Any given State/Union Territory is \nhowever, characterised by the fact that the quantum of rainfall received from one of these \ntwo monsoons is significantly much higher than that from the other.  Some states may \nreceive rainfall from both the monsoons equally. With these considerations in mind, a \nground water year for purposes of ground water assessment can be very conveniently \nconsidered to comprise of 12 calendar months beginning from the commencement of the \npredominant monsoon. \n1.3.2 SEASONS WITHIN A GROUND WATER YEAR \nThe ground water table is at the lowest level (or, farthest from the ground level) just prior \nto the onset of the predominant monsoon and reaches a peak (highest level or closest to \nthe ground level) a little before the cessation of the predominant monsoon. Thereafter, the \nground water table shows a declining trend with the recession limb having two significant \nsegments. The first segment has a relatively steeper slope and extends to about a month \nafter the cessation of the predominant monsoon. The second segment has a much flatter \nslope and extends up to the time when the predominant monsoon commences again is the \nnext year. Ground water is usually not  significantly developed for irrigation use during \nthe one month period corresponding to the first segment of the recession limb of the water \ntable hydrograph as mentioned above, because of availability of adequate moisture in the \nroot zone during this one month period. Keeping the above considerations in mind, a \nground water year can be conveniently sub-divided into the following two seasons : \na) ‘Monsoon Season’",
    "re in the \nroot zone during this one month period. Keeping the above considerations in mind, a \nground water year can be conveniently sub-divided into the following two seasons : \na) ‘Monsoon Season’ between the commencement of the predominant monsoon and \na month after its cessation. \nb) ‘Non-monsoon Season’ covering the rest of the ground water year. \nIt needs to be emphasised here that, the ‘Monsoon Season’ as defined above does not \ncoincide with the duration of the predominant monsoon as commonly u nderstood on the \nbasis of occurrence of rainfall, but in fact extends to a month after its cessation. Ground \nwater assessment computations will have to be made separately for these two seasons \nwithin a ground water year. \n1.3.3 PRE- MONSOON AND POST- MONSOON MONITORINGS \nWater table data as recorded from a number of observation wells will be used in the \nassessment of ground water. These water table data will have to be recorded during two \ntimes within a ground water year. These two specified times  are referre d to as ‘Pre -\n6 \n \nmonsoon’ and ‘Post - monsoon’ monitorings. The former corresponds to the calendar \nmonth just prior to the ‘Monsoon Season’, and the latter corresponds to the calendar \nmonth just after one month of the cessation of monsoon. \n1.3.4 GROUND WATER ASSESSMENT YEAR \nThe ground water year for which ground water assessment is made and reported is \nreferred to is as the ‘Ground Water Assessment Year’. \nThe components of gross ground water extraction,  recharge due to ‘Other Sources’ and \nresultant inflow into the system mentioned earlier in Section 1.1. are computed with \nreference to the ‘Ground Water  Assessment Year’. The component of recharge from \n‘Rainfall’ is however a little different in the sense that, the rainfall for which the rainfall \nrecharge is compu ted is not the rainfall during the ground water assessment year but a \n‘Normal Rainfall’ value obtained as the average rainfall over a sufficiently long number \nof ground water years",
    "recharge is compu ted is not the rainfall during the ground water assessment year but a \n‘Normal Rainfall’ value obtained as the average rainfall over a sufficiently long number \nof ground water years. The reasons for these are obvious. The components of gross ground \nwater extraction and recharge from ‘Other Sources’  and resultant inflows are to be \nassessed for an average situation.  Ground water assessment reports are to be prepared \nonce in three years. \n1.3.5 SUMMARY   \nBased on what has been described  earlier, the combinations of ground water year , \nmonsoon  &  non -monsoon  seasons  and pre -monsoon & post -monsoon monitorings \nwhich can be adopted by a particular State/Union Territory are summarised below : \n  \n7 \n \na) Applicable when the predominant monsoon is the  south-west monsoon and the  \nsame commences by late May or early June \n \nGround water \nyear\n \n: \n12 calendar months between \nJune of one calendar year and \nMay of next calendar year. \nMonsoon season 4 calendar months between June \nand September. \nNon-monsoon season the remaining 8 calendar months \nbetween October of one \ncalendar year  and May of  the \nnext calendar year. \nPre- monsoon  monitoring calendar month of May. \nPost- monsoon monitoring calendar month of October. \n \nb) Applicable when the predominant monsoon is the south-west monsoon and the   \nsame commences by end of June or early July. \n \nGround water \nyear\n \n: \n12 calendar months between July \nof one calendar year and June of \nnext calendar year. \nMonsoon season 4 calendar months between July \nand October. \nNon-monsoon season the remaining 8 calendar months \nbetween November of one \ncalendar year  and June of  the next \ncalendar year. \nPre- monsoon  monitoring calendar month of June . \nPost- monsoon monitoring calendar month of November. \n8 \n \n \nc) Applicable when the predominant monsoon is the north-east monsoon  \n \nGround water year : 12 calendar months between October of \none calendar year and September of next \ncalendar year",

Wherever a ‘Watershed’  is adopted as the type of ground \nwater assessment unit, each such watershed for which ground water assessment is made \ncan typically have a geographic area ranging between  ten thousand and thirty thousand \nhectares (100 and 300 sq.km.). To that extent, a watershed adopted as the assessment unit \nmay have a few sub-watersheds within it. Delineation of individual watersheds should be \ncarried out properly using Survey of India toposheets as the basis, and ensur ing that no \nareas within the State/Union Territory are left out, and that, the boundary of the \nassessment unit is a real water divide, except for those units which may h",

However, localised p ockets like valley fills, \nterraces, plateau etc., occurring within the region of greater than 20 percent slopes, but \nhaving good ground water potential should be included within one of the other three sub-\nunits mentioned above whichever is most appropriate . This sub-unit is characterised by \nmore run off and less ground water recharge, and hence no ground  water assessment is \nmade for it.  While demarcating hilly area, it is adviced to use DEM and use computer \ngenerated slope map. \n2.2.2 Area Suitable for Ground Water Recharge \nThe portion of the ground water assessment unit other than the hilly area as described in \nSection 2.2.1, is referred to as the area of the ground water a ssessment unit in which \n12 \n \nground water recharge is considerable. This area is further sub -divided into three sub -\nunits namely, poor ground water quality area, command area and non-command area. \n2.2.3 Poor Ground Water Quality Area \nThis sub -unit comprises of all portions of the ground water assessment unit in which \nground water recharge is possible, but in which ground water quality is beyond the \npermissible limits as adopted by the particular State/Union Territory for purpose of \nsuitability for irrigation use .

Ground water assessment is to be made  \nseparately for this sub-unit.  \n2.2.6 Non-Command Area \nThis sub-unit comprises of all portions of the good ground water quality area within the \nground water assessment unit as described in Section 2.2.4 and which is no t in the \ncommand of Major or Medium Irrigation project s..

In some States/Union  Territories ground water may  also be important to \nmeet industrial water supply requirements . The gross ground water extraction \ncomponents for the estimation of most probable  ground water extraction in an  year which \nare required to be known in respect of command  area, non -command area and poor \nground water quality area of each ground water assessment unit are listed below: \na) Gross ground water extraction for ‘Irrigation’ during monsoon and non-\nmonsoon seasons.  They are used for computing recharge from irrigation water \napplied by ground water irrigation (Chapter 6) \nb) Annual gross ground water extraction for ‘Irrigation’ and ‘Industrial’ use. It is \nused for computing net annual ground water ava ilability for ‘Future Use’ \n(Chapter 26). \nc) Annual gross ground water extraction for ‘All Uses’. It is used for computing \nthe current stage of ground water extraction     (Chapter 21). \nd) Gross ground water extraction for ‘All Uses’ during monsoon season . It is \nused for computing rainfall recharge during monsoon season by the water \ntable fluctuation method (Chapter 19). \nThe norms to be adopted and the assumptions to be made for estimating the ground water \nextraction components are likely to vary considerably from State to State. In other words, \nthe task of estimating the current gross ground water extraction components as listed \nabove is a highly location specific problem. Consequently it is difficult to specify a \ncommon uniform procedure to be followed by all States/Union Territories for computing \nthe ground water extraction components. Hence, all States/Union Territories are given the \nfreedom to adopt a pr",
    "common uniform procedure to be followed by all States/Union Territories for computing \nthe ground water extraction components. Hence, all States/Union Territories are given the \nfreedom to adopt a procedure most suitable to them. The only requirement is that all the \ncurrent gross ground water extraction components as listed above should be estimated \nwith as much accuracy as possible. No single method is accurate because of lack of valid \ndata available. Hence it is recommended to apply more than one method for estimating \nthe ground water extraction and take the average of those figures as the accepted ground \nwater extraction. If the ground water extraction computed by any one of the methods is \nvery much deviating from the other estimates, this may be ignored in the computation of \naccepted ground water extraction.  \n16 \n \nThe GEC 2015 methodology suggests the following methods for estimating the ground \nwater extraction. \nFor estimating Ground Water Extraction for Irrigation (GEIRR) \n Unit Draft Method \n Crop Water Requirement Method \n Power Consumption Method \nFor estimating Ground Water Extraction for Domestic Use (GEDOM)  \n Unit Draft Method \n Consumptive Use Method \nFor estimating Ground water Extraction for Industrial use (GEIND) \n Unit Draft Method \n Consumptive Use Pattern Method \nHence there are only five methods f or estimating any type of ground water extraction. \nThese are as follows: \n Unit Draft Method \n Crop Water Requirement Method \n Power Consumption Method \n Consumptive Use Method \n Consumptive Use Pattern Method \n3.2 ASSUMPTIONS \n3.2.1 Unit Draft Method \nIn unit draft method for estimating the ground water extraction for any use can be \nestimated by following the suggested procedure which has the following assumptions.  \na) Different types of wells which are commonly used in the ground water assessment \nsub unit are identified and unit ground water extraction per well during monsoon \nand non-monsoon seasons for each type are to be",

Remote sensing techniques may also be applied for \nacquiring this data. \n17 \n \nc) The gross ground water extraction for Irrigation is finally estimated using the \nresults from ‘a’ and ‘b’ above.  \n3.2.3 Power Consumption Method \nEstimation of the ground water extraction using power consumption method following \nthe suggested procedure has the following assumptions.  \na) Ground water extracted for a unit of electricity consumed for different \nhydrogeological conditions is to be estimated during monsoon and non-monsoon \nseasons through field studies. \nb) Total power consumed in each of the hydrogeological units mentioned in a are to \nbe collected from the electricity department.  \nc) The gross ground water extraction for irrigation is finally estimated using the \nresults from ‘a’ and ‘b’ above.  \n3.2.4 Consumptive Use Method \nEstimation of the ground  water extraction using consumptive use method following",

    "CEDURE \n3.3.1 Unit Draft Method \nDifferent types of wells which are commonly used in the ground water assessment unit \nare first identified. The ground water extraction per well per day and the number of days \nduring which the wells are used in the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are then \nestimated for each type of well. These estimates are finally used to obtain the unit ground \nwater extraction per well in the monsoon and non-monsoon seasons for each type of well.  \nAll wells of the same type are such that, each of them, \na) have more or less the same ground water withdrawal per day,  \nb) are  more  or less  used   for  the  same number of  days during  monsoon  and  \nnon-monsoon seasons respectively and  \nc) have a single use (either irrigation, domestic water supply or industrial water \nsupply) to which they are put to. \nThe last requirement mentioned above arises as a result of the need to estimate separately \nthe gross ground water extraction for different uses. However, there may be some types \nof wells which are employed for more than one use. In such cases, a separate type is \nconsidered for each use, and unit ground water extraction per well should be separately \nestimated for each usage. Also, the ground water withdrawal from the same type of well \nwill be usually more in the non -command area than in the command area, because of \nmore extensive use of the wells in the non -command area. In such cases also, the same \ntype of well should be a ctually considered as two different types, and unit ground water \nextraction per well should be separately estimated for each of the sub unit. \nThe unit draft or the ground water extraction per well per season is computed as below: \n10000\nDays of No. * meters/day cubicin  Extraction = hamin season per  per well Extraction Water Groundor Draft Unit \nThis Unit draft whatever is estimated is for the year of field study for the rainfall of that \nyear.

The fractional load (Lg) is 0 means \nthe area is fully dependent on surface water, whereas 1 in dicates that the area  is fully \ndependent on ground water.

    "e \nparameters: \ni) seepage factor expressed in hectare metres per day per million square \nmetres of wetted area \nii) wetted area in million square metres \niii) number of days the canal reach is in operation \nb) The seepage factor mentioned in 'a' above, depends only on the following factors- \ni) whether the canal segment is lined or unlined \n 66 \nii) whether the soil type over which the canal segment traverses is normal soil \nor sandy soil or the canal reach is on a hard rock terrain. \nc) The seepage factor mentioned in 'a' above , can be assigned a value either from \nthe specified norms as given in the Annexure I, or on the basis of results from  \ndocumented field studies.  \nd) The average depth of flow in a canal segment during the duration in which it is in \noperation can be considered to be 0.6 times the design depth of flow of that canal \nsegment if average supply depth is not available. \n4.3 COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nThe computational procedure which is to be adopted for estimating recharge from canals \nin any sub unit during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is as given below. \nMain canals, major canals, minor canals and distributaries in the canal system alone are \nconsidered for computing recharge from canals. They are divided in to a number of canal \nreaches, each having a specified length.  Each such canal reach in its entire stretch, \na. is either lined or unlined, \nb. traverses the same soil/rock type, \nc. has same value of design depth of flow, same value of base width and same \nvalue of side slope, and \nd. is in operation for the same number of days in a given season. \nThe wetted area in million square metres for each canal segment is computed making use \nof data on length, base width, side slope and design depth of flow  using the following \nformulae. \nWetted Area= Wetted perimeter * Length \nWidthBedSideAngleSin\nDepthSupplyAveragePerimeterWetted  )(\n*2\n \nThe canal seepage factor in hectare metres per day per million square metres of wetted \narea is as",
    "ed Area= Wetted perimeter * Length \nWidthBedSideAngleSin\nDepthSupplyAveragePerimeterWetted  )(\n*2\n \nThe canal seepage factor in hectare metres per day per million square metres of wetted \narea is assigned to each canal segment based on either the norms as given in Annexure I \nor on the basis of results obtained from documented field studies.  \nThe data on wetted area and canal seepage factor as discussed in the previous two sections \nare then used  along with data on the number of days the canal segment is in operation \nduring monsoon and non -monsoon seasons to estimate the recharge due to canal s from \neach canal segment. \nRecharge due to canal reach = Wetted Area*Days*Seepage Factor \nRecharge from canals in the command area during monsoon and non-monsoon season are \nfinally obtained as the sum of the recharge values computed for each canal segment.  \n4.4 FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR COMPUTATION \n4.4.1 Command Area \nThe recharge due to canals in command area are to be presented in Tables 4.1 to 4.4. The \nlocation details of all the canal segments in the command area are presented in the Table \n4.1. The wetted area computation are presented in the Table 4.2. Assigning the Seepage \n 67 \nfactor is presented i n the Table 4.3 and the recharge due to canals during monsoon and \nnon-monsoon seasons are computed in the  Table 4.4. The r echarge from canals in the \ncommand area during monsoon and non-monsoon season are finally obtained as the sum \nof the recharge values computed for each canal segment.  \n4.4.2 Poor Ground water Quality Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating recharge from canals in the poor \nground water quality area is identical to what has been described earlier in Section 4.4.1 \nfor command area.

Each such outlet is \nlocated in the distributaries of the canal system. \nb) the water released in hectare metres from each outlet as mentioned in ‘b’ above \ncan be computed as the product of the following parameters  \ni) average discharge of the outlet in hectare metres per day \nii) number of days water is actually released from the outlet \nc) if average discharge is not available, it is assumed that  0.6 times of the design \ndischarge is the average discharge. \nd) the return flow factor mentioned in ‘a’ ab",
    "ally released from the outlet \nc) if average discharge is not available, it is assumed that  0.6 times of the design \ndischarge is the average discharge. \nd) the return flow factor mentioned in ‘a’ above depends only on the following \nfactors \n 78 \ni)      whether the crop irrigated is paddy or non-paddy \nii) The range of depth to water table below ground level  \niii) whether the release from outlets is continuous or rotational. \ne) the return flow factor mentioned in ‘a’ and ‘e ’ above can be assigned a value \neither on the basis of norms as given in Annexure II or on the basis of results  \nfrom documented field studies.  \n5.3 COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for computing the recharge from irrigation water \napplied by surface water irrigation in any sub unit is described in this section. \n5.3.1 Irrigation Water Applied  \nThe  average  water  released  from  each  outlet  during  the  monsoon  and  non-monsoon \nseason are computed. The irrigation water applied during these two seasons are obtained \nas the sum of the releases from each outlet.  This can be calculated using the following \nformula.  \nIrrigation Water Applied = Average Discharge *No. of days water is released by the \noutlet \n \nIf average discharge from the canal outlets are available, this data is to be used in \ncomputing irrigation water applied. If the average data is not available, then 60% of the \ndesign discharge may be considered as average discharge. \n5.3.2 Depth to Water Table Below Ground Level \nThe average depth to water table bel ow ground level in the  subunit  as a whole during \nthe monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are to be categorised based on the depth to water \nlevel to assign the return flow factor for paddy and non paddy in the area. \na) Less than 10 metres \nb) Between 10 and 25 metres with 1m zonation \nc) Greater than 25 metres \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for this purpose is given below : \na) The following data on depth to water table below",
    "b) Between 10 and 25 metres with 1m zonation \nc) Greater than 25 metres \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for this purpose is given below : \na) The following data on depth to water table below ground level as recorded from \neach of the observation wells in the command area are considered. \ni) during pre -monsoon monitoring month of  the current ground water \nassessment  year \nii) during post -monsoon monitoring month  of  current ground water \nassessment year \niii) during pre -monsoon monitoring month  of the ground water year \nimmediately  following the current ground water assessment year. \nb) The above three water table data items applicable for the sub-unit as a whole are \nobtained as the arithmetic average of the corresponding data from all the \nobservation wells considered.  \nc) Average depth of  water table below ground level in the sub-unit as a whole \nduring the monsoon season is computed as the arithmetic mean of the \n 79 \nwater table data during pre -monsoon and post -monsoon monitoring \nmonths of the current ground water assessment ye ar as  obtained in ‘b’ \nabove. \nd) Average depth of water table below ground level in the sub-unit as a whole \nduring the non-monsoon season is computed as the arithmetic mean of the \nwater table data during post -monsoon monitoring month  of the current \nground water assessment year and pre-monsoon monitoring month of the \nground water year immediately following the current ground water \nassessment year as obtained in ‘b’ above. \ne) The results obtained from ‘c’ and ‘d’ above or made use of to categorise \nthe depth to water table below ground level in the subunit during monsoon \nand non-monsoon seasons to assign a return flow factor as per the norms \nsuggested by GEC 2015. \n5.3.3  Irrigated Area Under Paddy and Non-paddy \nThe irrigated area in acres under paddy and  non -paddy in the subunit during monsoon \nand non-monsoon seasons of the current ground water assessment year are estimated by \nadopting any convenient",
    "y \nThe irrigated area in acres under paddy and  non -paddy in the subunit during monsoon \nand non-monsoon seasons of the current ground water assessment year are estimated by \nadopting any convenient method. The most obvious method, though it will be time \nconsuming, is through a ctual field survey. They can also be estimated indirectly, using \ninformation on irrigation water applied  and irrigation water requirement of the crops. \nThis data can be collected from agricultural department also.  \n5.3.4  Return Flow Factor \nThe return flow factor for the sub unit during monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are \nobtained either on the basis of the norms as given in Annexure  II or on the basis of results \nfrom documented field studies. The use of the norms require information on depth to \nwater table and irrigated area mentioned in the previous two sections.  The weighted \naverage return flow factor can be calculated using the following formula. \n \n5.3.5  Recharge Due to Irrigation Water Applied \nThe estimates of irrigation water applied and the return flow factor are then made use of \nto compute the recharge from irrigation water applied by surface water irrigation in the \nsub-unit during the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons of the current ground wat er \nassessment year.  The Recharge from applied surface water irrigation can be computed \nusing the following formula. \n \nRecharge due to surface water irrigation = Irrigation Water Applied * Return Flow Factor \n5.4 FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \nThe formats suggested in the computation of the recharge from irrigation water applied \nby surface water sources in the sub-units are described in the following sections. \nAreaPaddyNonAreaPaddy\nRFFPaddyNonAreaPaddyNonRFFPaddyAreaPaddyRFFAverageWeighted \n\n 80 \n5.4.1 Command Area \nThe location details of all the outlets in the canal system are present ed in the Table 5.1. \nThe  actual  water  released  from  each  outlet  during  the  monsoon    and  non-monsoon \nseasons",

Command area \nb. Non-command area \nc. Poor groundwater quality area \nThe computation of recharge from irrigation water applied by ground water sources in a \ngiven sub-unit during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out: \na. Estimation of irrigation water applied by ground water irrigation . \nb. Estimation of average depth to water table below ground level. \nc. Estimation of irrigated area under paddy and non-paddy. \nd. Assigning a return flow factor on the basis of  results from ‘b’ and ‘c’ \nabove. \ne. Computation of  the required recharge on the basis of  results from ‘a’ and \n‘d’ above. \n6.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computation of recharge from irrigation water applied by ground water sources  is \nbased on the following assumptions : \na) Recharge in hectare metres can be obtained as the product of the following \nparameters : \ni. Irrigation water applied in hectare metres \nii. Return flow factor as a fraction \nb) The irrigation water applied",
    "ge in hectare metres can be obtained as the product of the following \nparameters : \ni. Irrigation water applied in hectare metres \nii. Return flow factor as a fraction \nb) The irrigation water applied as mentioned in ‘a’ above is considered as the \ngross groundwater extraction  for irrigation as obtained in Chapter 3. In other \nwords, the transmission losses are considered as nil. \nc) The return flow factor mentioned in ‘a’ above depends only on the following \nparameters: \ni. Whether the crop irrigated is paddy or non-paddy. \n 102 \nii. The range of depth to water table below ground level  \nd) The return flow factor mentioned in ‘a’ and ‘c’ above can be assigned a value \neither on the basis o f norms as given in Annexure II  or on the basis of  results \nfrom documented field studies. \n6.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for computing the recharge from irrigation water \napplied by ground water sources in any sub unit is described in this section. \n6.3.1 Irrigation Water Applied  \nThe gross ground water extraction for irrigation , during the monsoon and non-monsoon \nseasons in any of the sub unit as computed in Chapter 3 are considered as the irrigation \nwater  applied  by  ground  water sources.  \n6.3.2 Depth to Water Table Below Ground Level \nThe average depth to water table below ground l evel in the  subunit  as a whole during \nthe monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are to be categorised based on the depth to water \nlevel to assign the return flow factor for paddy and non-paddy in the area. \na) Less than 10 metres \nb) Between 10 and 25 metres with 1m zonation \nc) Greater than 25 metres \nThe computational scheme to adopted for this purpose is given below : \na) The following data on depth to water table below ground level as recorded from \neach of the observation wells in the sub unit are considered. \ni. during pre -monsoon monitoring month of  the current ground water \nassessment  year \nii. during post -monsoon monitoring month  of  cur",

The most obvious method, though it will be time \nconsuming, is through actual field survey. They can also  be estimated indirectly, using \ninformation on irrigation water applied  and irrigation water requirement of the crops. \nThis d",

They can also  be estimated indirectly, using \ninformation on irrigation water applied  and irrigation water requirement of the crops. \nThis data can be collected from agricultural department also.  \n6.3.4  Return Flow Factor \nThe return flow factor for the sub unit during monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are \nobtained either on the basis of the norms as given in Annexure  II or on the basis of results \nfrom documented field studies. The use of the norms require information on depth to \nwater table and irrigated area mentioned in the previous two sections.  The weighted \naverage return flow factor can be calculated using the following formula. \n \n6.3.5  Recharge \nThe estimates of irrigation water applied and the return flow factor are then made use of \nto compute the recharge from irr igation water appli ed by ground water sources in the \nsubunit during the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons of the current ground water \nassessment year.  The Recharge from applied ground  water irrigation can be computed \nusing the following formula. \nRecharge due to ground water irrigation = Irrigation Water Applied * Return Flow Factor \n6.4 FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \nThe formats suggested in the computation of the recharge from applied ground water \nirrigation in the subunits are described in the following sections. \n6.4.1 Command Area \nThe gross ground water extraction for irrigation during monsoon and non -monsoon \nseasons as computed in Chapter 3 are considered as irrigation water applied by ground \nwater sources. The results are presented in Table 6.1 The depth to water during monsoon \nand non-monsoon seasons are computed in Table 6.2. The irrigated area under paddy and  \nnon-paddy in the subunit  are estimated in Table 6.3 .

The water conservation structures include \npercolation tanks, check dams, nulla bunds etc. Recharge from water conservat ion \nstructures are to be computed during  monsoon  and non-monsoon seasons of the current \nground water assessment year for the following sub -units within each ground water \nassessment unit :  \na) Command area \nb) Non-command area \nc) Poor ground water quality area  \nThe  computations of  recharge from  water conservation structures in a given sub -unit \nand during a given season involves the following steps to",
    "Non-command area \nc) Poor ground water quality area  \nThe  computations of  recharge from  water conservation structures in a given sub -unit \nand during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out : \na) Computing recharge from each water conservation structure based on \ngross storage of that structure \nb) Obtaining the total recharge as the sum of the recharge from each water  \nconservation structure \n8.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of recharge from water conservation structures are based on the \nfollowing assumptions : \na) Annual recharge in hectare metres from each water conservation structure can be \nobtained as the product of the following three parameters : \ni) Storage capacity of the structure in hectare metres \nii) Number of fillings which take place in a ground water year (This can be a    \nfraction greater than zero and sometimes it can be more than one also) \niii) A  Recharge factor, which is recommended as of 0.4 \nb) The annual recharge from all water conservation structures is obtained as the sum \nof the recharge from each structure \nc) The annual recharge from all water conservation structures is distributed equally \nduring the monsoon and non-monsoon seasons of a ground water year \n 132 \n8.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nThe scheme for computing recharge from water conservation structures in any of the sub \nunits during the mons oon and non -monsoon seasons of the current ground water \nassessment year comprises of the following steps \na) The storage capacity in hectare metres of each water conservation structure and \nthe number of fillings in each of them during the current ground water \nassessment year are obtained. The gross annual storage in hectare metres of \neach structure is then obtained as the product of  these two values.  \nb) The annual recharge in hectare metres from each water conservation structure \nis obtained by multiplying the gross annual storage of that structure  with the \nrecharge factor.

Wherever the \nassessment units are blocks, there will be a ground water flow across the boundaries. Even \nin hydrological boundaries like watersheds, if the water divide is of low relief, then also \nthere is a possibility of ground water flow depending on the condition of ground water \nheads in the area. In GEC 1997 methodology it is assumed that lateral inflows into the \nassessment u nit are equivalent to ground water outflows. But this is always not true. \nHence GEC 2015 suggested to compute the Lateral Flows along the Aquifer System or \nThrough Flows and utilise in the estimation of ground water balancing components. \nFor assessing the through flow, there should be well distributed network of ground water \nlevel observation wells.  As other components are normalized in one or other methods, \nthis component also to be estimated for an average situation. Hence there is a requirement \nof minimum 5 sets of data during pre -monsoon and post -monsoon seasons for all the \nobservation wells. Generally there will not be more than three wells in an assessment sub \nunit, hence this exercise should  be done to a bigger area to calculate the hydraulic \ngradient. This hydraulic gradient can be used for the boundaries of the assessment sub \nunit in calculating the flow. \nThe  computations of  through flow from/into the assessment sub unit during a given \nseason involves the following steps to be carried out",
    "ndaries of the assessment sub \nunit in calculating the flow. \nThe  computations of  through flow from/into the assessment sub unit during a given \nseason involves the following steps to be carried out : \na) Computing average ground water head for both the seasons by taking the ground \nwater head data of at least five years. \nb) Computing the Average Groundwater heads during monsoon season and non -\nmonsoon season separately. \nc) Preparation of Ground water Table contour with suitable contour interval for both \nthe seasons. \nd) Computation of Hydraulic gradient at required number of places for both the \nseasons. \n 148 \ne) Depending on the variation in hydraulic gradients, demarcation of sections on the \nboundary for both the seasons.  \nf) Computation of Flow across the boundary for each of the section for both the \nseasons. \ng) Summation of the flow across boundary for each of the section and resultant \nthrough flow for both the seasons. \n10.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of lateral flow across the boundar y are  based on the following \nassumptions : \na) The average ground water head of pre monsoon season and the post monsoon \nseason of the assessment year is considered as the ground water head during \nmonsoon season. Similarly, the average ground water head of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water head of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water head during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) The ground water flow across the boundary can be obtained as t he product of \nfollowing: \ni) Transmissivity of the aquifer \nii) Length of section \niii) Hydraulic gradient across the section. \niv) No. of days flow exists across the boundary in the given season \nc) The ground water flow across the boundary f rom the assessment sub unit is \nobtained as the algebraic sum of the ground water flow across the boundary from \nall the sections. \n10.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nAs per the existing density of network st",
    "the assessment sub unit is \nobtained as the algebraic sum of the ground water flow across the boundary from \nall the sections. \n10.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nAs per the existing density of network stations, it may be difficult to compute the \nhydraulic gradient for each assessment sub unit separately. Depending on the availability \nof network stations, the estimation of hydraulic gradient may be done for each assessment \nsub unit, assessment unit or to a group of assessment units. The  computations of  through \nflow from/into the assessment sub unit during a given season involves the following steps \nto be carried out : \n10.3.1 Average Ground Water Head \nFor knowing the most probable through flow from/into assessment sub unit the average \nground water heads for both the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are needed. The \naverage ground water head in any season may be computed as the average of ground \nwater head observed by taking the ground water head data of at least five years data. The \naverage groundwater heads during monsoon season an d non-monsoon season are to be \nestimated separately.  For each of the year under consideration, the average of Pre -\nmonsoon water level and post monsoon water level may be considered as monsoon season \nwater level and the average of post monsoon water level of current year and pre monsoon \nwater level of succeeding year may be considered as non-monsoon water level. \n 149 \n10.3.2 Average Hydraulic Gradient \nHydraulic gradient is the ratio between change in head and the distance between the \nobservations. For computing average hydraulic gradient, water table contour map with \nsuitable contour interval is to be prepared. The hydraulic gradient at required numbe r of \nplaces can be computed by calculating the head difference between contours along the \nflow direction and computing the distance between  both the contours. The average \nhydraulic gradient for monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to be estimated \nseparately. \n10.3",
    "tours along the \nflow direction and computing the distance between  both the contours. The average \nhydraulic gradient for monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to be estimated \nseparately. \n10.3.3 Ground Water Flow Across Boundary \nThe Hydraulic gradient may not be uniform throughout the boundary. Hence it is essential \nto divide the entire boundary into various sections where the hydraulic gradient is \nconstant. For each section, the g round water flows can be estimated by multiplying \nTransmissivity of the aquifer, hydraulic gradient, length of the section and number of days \ninflow/ outflow occurs through the section during the season.  Depending on the direction \nof flow, the flow should  be given sign, positive sign for inflows and negative sign for \noutflows. The flow across the boundary for monsoon season and non-monsoon season are \nto be estimated separately. \n10.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n10.4.1  Command Area  \nWater Level during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is computed for all the years and \nthe average monsoon season water level and non-monsoon water level is calculated as the \naverage of at least last five years data and is presented in Table 10.1. The computed \naverage wa ter levels during monsoon season and non -monsoon seasons along with \nlatitude and longitudes are presented in Table 10.2. Using the water table data, water table \ncontour maps are prepared in Map 10.1 and Map 10.2 for monsoon season and non -\nmonsoon seasons respectively. From these maps hydraulic gradient is to be computed for \nentire area. But the spacing between the contours vary with space. Hence the entire \nboundary is divided into number of sections,  such that  each section will have equal \nspacing between contours and in turn same hydraulic gradient.  Hydraulic gradients are \ncalculated in Table 10.3 and Table 10.4 for monsoon season and non -monsoon season \nrespectively. Once the hydraulic gradient is computed and length of the section is noted \nusing",
    "ulic gradients are \ncalculated in Table 10.3 and Table 10.4 for monsoon season and non -monsoon season \nrespectively. Once the hydraulic gradient is computed and length of the section is noted \nusing darcy’s law ground water flow across the boundary is computed in Table 10.5 and \nTable 10.6  for monsoon season and non -monsoon season respectively. Care must be \ntaken to include the positive sign for inflows and negative sign for outflows. The resultant \nflow into or out of the sub unit is calculated as the algebraic sum of the flows of all \nsections on the boundary.  \n10.4.2  Non-Command  Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopte d for estimating the lateral flow across the \nboundary in the non -command area during monsoon and non -monsoon seasons is \nidentical to what has been described earlier in Section 10.4.1 for the command area. The \n 150 \ncomputations are presented in  Tables 10.7 to 10.12 and the maps are presented in Maps \n10.3 and 10.4. \n10.4.3  Poor Ground Water Quality Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the lateral flow across the \nboundary in the poor ground water quality area during monsoon and non -monsoon \nseasons is identical to what has been described earlier in Section 10.4.1 for the command \narea. The computations are presented in  Tables 10.13 to 10.18 and the maps are presented \nin Maps 10.5 and 10.6. \n10.5 STRUCTURE OF DATABASE PROPOSED \nThe following structure is proposed for the data elements pertain to the estimation of \nlateral flows along the aquifer system. \nS.No Parameter Type Size Decimals \n1 Assessment Sub Unit Text 20  \n2 Through Flow section ID Text 20  \n3 Average Hydraulic gradient Through seepage face  \nDuring monsoon Season \nNumber 7 2 \n4 Average Hydraulic gradient Through seepage face  \nDuring Non-Monsoon Season \nNumber 7 2 \n5 Transmissivity of the Aquifer Number 8 2 \n6 Length of Seepage Section Number 8 2 \n7 Through flow During Monsoon Season Number 8 0 \n8 Through flow During Non-Monsoon Season  Numbe",

If the ground water head is above the stage in the  local \nstream, the ground water flows from the aquifer to the stream, this is known as base flow. \nThe preferred method for this estima",
    "s base flow. If the ground water head is above the stage in the  local \nstream, the ground water flows from the aquifer to the stream, this is known as base flow. \nThe preferred method for this estimation is base flow separation using the stream \nhydrograph. There are many methods and softwares for estimating the base flow. In the \nabsence of any software and the required competency, the following procedure of \nhydrograph separation with straight line method can be used. If continuous stream gauge \ndata is not available, then one can use the method described in the Chapter 12 i.e stream \nrecharge for estimating the base flow also. \nFor assessing the base flow, there should be stream discharge data for at least five years. \nIf the stream gauge is not at the mouth of the assessment unit, there should be two stream \ngauges one in the upstream direction and the other one is at the downstream side. The \nbase flow generated in the assessment sub unit will be the difference of  base flow  \ncomputed at upstream and downstream stream gauges.   If required, it should be \napportioned as per the catchment area. As in the case of other components which are \nnormalized, this component is also to be estimated for an average situation. Hence there \nis a requirement of minimum 5 sets of daily discharge data of either one stream gauge, if \nthe gauging is done at the mouth of the hydrological assessment unit. In case of other \nareas there is a need of at least two stream gauge stations. The base flow is estimated for \nthe entire assessment unit and apportioned for the sub units depending on the areas if the \nassessment is hydrological unit. If assessment unit is administrative unit, then the base \nflow estimation is to be estimated for a hydrological unit and apportion the base flow for \nthe respective sub units depending on the area of the sub units. \nThe  computations of  base flow in the assessment sub unit s during a given season \ninvolves the following steps to be carried out :",
    "the respective sub units depending on the area of the sub units. \nThe  computations of  base flow in the assessment sub unit s during a given season \ninvolves the following steps to be carried out : \na) Selection of area for the estimation of base  flow. If the assessment unit is a \nhydrological unit, the same can be selected for the estimation of base flow for all \nthe sub units. If the assessment unit is as administrative unit the hydrological unit \ncovering entire assessment unit should be selected. \nb) If the stream gauge is at the mouth of the hydrological unit, the entire base  flow \ngenerated by the stream can be estimated with only one stream gauge. If the stream \ngauge is not at the mouth, then there is a need of at least two stream gauge stations \nto estimate the base flow generated by the area. \n 177 \nc) Computing average daily stream discharge  by taking the average of stream \ndischarge of at least five years. \nd) Estimation of base flow during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons separately. \ne) Apportioning the base flow for each of the sub units. \n11.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe estimation of base flow is based on the following assumptions : \na) The average stream discharge of the stream gauge is computed for estimating \nthe average situation.  \nb) During monsoon season, number of direct runoff spells are to be identified. \nc) For each of the direct runoff spells starting point discharge and the ending \npoint stream discharge are noted to estimate the lower bound of the direct run \noff . \nd) The lower bound of the direct runoff is estimated as a linear function between \nstarting point discharge and end point discharge. \ne) The stream discharge up to the lower bound of the direct runoff is the base \nflow. \nf) This can be converted to hectare meters per day. \ng) If the gauge is at the mouth of the hydrological unit, then the sum of the daily \nbase flow will be the total base flow generated from this unit. \nh) If it is not at the mouth, the difference between the disc",
    "auge is at the mouth of the hydrological unit, then the sum of the daily \nbase flow will be the total base flow generated from this unit. \nh) If it is not at the mouth, the difference between the discharges at the upstream \ngauge and the downstream gauge is the base flow generated in the area \ncovered by these stream gauges. This should be apportioned for the area under \nconsideration. \ni) The base flow generated in the non-monsoon will be the total discharge in the \nstream as there will not be any direct runoff. \n11.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nIt is advisable to have a closed hydrological boundaries as assessment units. But this is \nnot always possible. Hence the following procedure is suggested to carry out the \ncomputations. It is necessary to have this estimation for entire assessment unit and \napportion between various sub units. Wherever the assessment unit is a closed watershed \nand all the rainfall occurring in the area forms a stream and we have a gauging station at \nthe mouth of the watershed, the base flow separation algorithm should be appl ied to the \ngauge on the mouth and whatever base flow generated is apportioned between various \nsub units. . \nSometimes, the assessment unit may not be a closed watershed and may contribute to the \nstream which may be computed as the difference in the base flow generated at the stream \ngauge at the upstream side and the stream gauge at the downstream. But this also may not \nbe strictly from the assessment unit and may be somewhat from a larger area of catchment. \nHence, it is recommended to demarcate a larger catchment area of the stream from which \nit is getting the base flow and the base flow is then apportioned between various sub units.  \n 178 \nSometimes the stream gauges may be less in number and may not be possible to estimate \nthe base flow for any single assessment unit. In such a case it may be attempted to estimate \nthe base flow for a group of assessment units and apportion the same. The disposition of \nthe",
    "to estimate \nthe base flow for any single assessment unit. In such a case it may be attempted to estimate \nthe base flow for a group of assessment units and apportion the same. The disposition of \nthe assessment units and stream gauges is presented in Map 11.1. \nFor deciding on the availability of stream gauge stations and deciding on the feasibility \nof accurate estimation, field ground water scientist is the better person. Hence if felt it is \nnot feasible, it should be planned to establish more number of stream gauges before \nestimating the base flow.. \n11.3.1 Average Stream Discharge \nFor knowing the most probable base flow from the assessment unit the average daily \nstream discharges of the stream during  the monsoon and non -monsoon sea sons are \nneeded. The average stream discharge of a day may be computed as the average of stream \ndischarge observed on the same day of at least last five years. The average daily stream \ndischarges may be estimated for the entire year. \n11.3.2 Direct Runoff Spells \nThe stream discharge against time is plotted on a rithmetic graph to know various direct \nrun off spells. Even though there are many more methods to compute base flow, it is \nrecommended to use the straight line method as it is the simplest method. For this purpose \nto implement, the starting discharge and e nd time discharge of each of the direct runoff \nspells is required to be known. These two points are joined by a straight line and the \nbottom of this line nothing but base flow. The upstream hydrograph is presented as Map \n11.2 where as down stream hydrograph is presented as Map 11.3. \n11.3.3 Base Flow Generated by the Area Under Study \nIf there are two stream gauge stations one at the upstream side of the area and the other \nat the downstream side of the area, the base flow should be computed for both the stations \nand the difference between these two would be the base flow generated by the area of the \ncatchment of the stream between these two points. To know",
    "base flow should be computed for both the stations \nand the difference between these two would be the base flow generated by the area of the \ncatchment of the stream between these two points. To know the base flow generated by a \nsub unit is calculated by apportioning this base flow for the area of the sub unit. \n11.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n11.4.1  Monsoon Season \nThere are three possibilities already discussed that there may be a suitable stream gauge \nat the mouth of a closed watershed. In this case only one  stream gauge data is analysed \nusing the formats suggested for downstream stream gauge. .But in cases where the stream \nis not completely covering the watershed. In such cases two stream gauges one  at the \nupstream and the other at downstream side has to be analysed and the difference between \nthe baseflow will be the baseflow generated by the watershed. The third situation is \nsimilar to the earlier case but the assessment unit may not be covering entire catchment \nbetween the stream gauges. Hence the baseflow generated is to be apportioned for the sub \nunits.  \n 179 \nThe base flow estimation from the stream gauges also to be estimated for the average \nsituation of at least five years. The average stream discharge is computed by taking \naverage of previous five years data of the same day. This computation is done in Table \n11.1. The direct runoff spells and their starting stream discharge and end discha rge and \nno of days of  the spell and the slope of the discharge of the spell  in the area during \nmonsoon season is Tabulated in Table 11.2. The base flow is computed using the straight \nline method is in Table 11.3. Similarly the base flow is computed in the downstream \nstream gauge and is presented in Tables 11.4 to11.6. The apportioning of the computed \nbase flow to various sub units viz. command are, non -command area and poor ground \nwater quality area is presented in Table 11.11. \n11.4.2  Non-Monsoon Season \nThe computational scheme",
    "the computed \nbase flow to various sub units viz. command are, non -command area and poor ground \nwater quality area is presented in Table 11.11. \n11.4.2  Non-Monsoon Season \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the base flow in the non-monsoon \nseason  is identical to what has been described earlier in Section 1 1.4.1 for the monsoon \nseason . The only difference is that most of the time the entire stream run off is nothing \nbut base flow, but where ever the rainfall spells occur in the area the procedure will be \nsame. Where ever there is direct run off spell, the procedure is same as that of  monsoon \nseason. As already average discharges are computed even for non monsoon season, \nbaseflows can be estimated in Tables 11.7 to 11.10. The apportioning of the computed \nbase flow to various sub units viz. command are a, non-command area and poor ground \nwater quality area is presented in Table 11.11. \n11.5 STRUCTURE OF DATABASE PROPOSED \nThe following structure is proposed for the data elements pertain to the estimation of base \nflow. \nS.No Parameter Type Size Decimals \n1 Assessment Sub Unit Text 20  \n2 River Segment ID Text 20  \n3 Stream Flow Number 8 2 \n4 Base Flow Number 8 2 \n5 Total Base flow During Monsoon Season Number 9 2 \n6 Total Base flow During Monsoon Season Number 9 2 \n7 Sub Unit Base flow During Monsoon Season Number 9 2 \n8 Sub Unit Base flow During Non-Monsoon Season Number 9 2 \n9 Direct Runoff Spell No. Number 2  \n10 Start Day Number 3  \n11 End Day Number 3   \n12 No of Days Number 2   \n13 Discharge at Beginning Number 8 2 \n14 Discharge at End Number 8 2 \n15 Discharge Difference Number 8 2 \n16 Slope of baseflow line Number 8 2 \n \n 180 \nMAP 11.1: Disposition of Stream Gauges in the Assessment Units \n \n \nName of Ground Water Assessment Unit :  Ground Water Assessment Year :  \nPrincipal Aquifer :  Major Aquifer :  \nIndex Number of Ground Water Assessment Unit :     \n 181 \nTable  11.1    Average Stream Discharge at the Stream Gauge Located a",

If the aquifer contributes to stream it is called base \nflow and the contribution from stream to aquifer is called stream recharge. Base flow may \nbe estimated using the base flow separation from stream hydrograph method as discussed \nin the Chapter 11. This method gives more accurate  result and at the same time this will \nhave coherence with what was computed by surface water people. In case the data of the \nstream discharges are not available sufficiently, then this method can be applied even for \nestimating base flow. \nFor assessing the stream recharge , there should be well distributed network of ground \nwater level observation wells and sufficient data of the stream stage. If stream is dry then \nthe elevation of the stream bed should b",
    "am recharge , there should be well distributed network of ground \nwater level observation wells and sufficient data of the stream stage. If stream is dry then \nthe elevation of the stream bed should be available at sufficient number of p laces. The \nstream stage is required at least at the peak direct runoff level and minimum level, so that \nthe average monsoon season stage of the stream can be estimated. \nAs other components are normalized in one or other methods, this component also to be \nestimated for an average situation. Hence there is a requirement of minimum 5 set s of \ndata d uring pre -monsoon and post -monsoon seasons for all the observation wells. \nSimilarly, the stream stage data also is required for five years.. \nThe  computations of  stream recharge in the assessment sub unit during a given season \ninvolves the following steps : \na) Computing average ground water head for both the seasons by taking the ground \nwater head data of at least five years data. \nb) Computing the Average Groundwater heads during monsoon season and non -\nmonsoon season separately. \nc) Average Stream Stage  for the monsoon & non-monsoon seasons taking average \nof maximum and minimum of the seasons respectively. \nd) Preparation of head contour with suitable contour interval s taking into \nconsideration ground water heads for both the seasons  taking into account the \nstream stage points as observation wells. \ne) Incorporating stream stage data in preparing the map it will give more accurate \nestimation of flow. If river stage is not available, the estimation of flow can be \nestimated using only ground water heads. \nf) Computation of Hydraulic gradient at required number of places for both the \nseasons on the stream line. \n 195 \ng) Depending on the variation in hydraulic gradients  along the stream line , \ndemarcation of sections on the river line for both the seasons may be made. \nh) Computation of Flow of water through the stream line for each of the section for \nboth the seaso",
    "long the stream line , \ndemarcation of sections on the river line for both the seasons may be made. \nh) Computation of Flow of water through the stream line for each of the section for \nboth the seasons. \ni) Consider only those segments where the flow direction is from stream to aquifer. \nj) Summation of the stream recharge from all the sections indicate the stream \nrecharges to the aquifer system for both the seasons. \nk) The base flow is to be estimated using hydrograph separation method. If it is not \npossible, this method may be used for estimating  the base flow comp onent by \nconsidering the segments where the flow direction is towards streams. \n12.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of the stream recharge are based on the following assumptions : \na) The average ground water head of pre monsoon season and the post monsoon \nseason of the assessment year is considered as the ground wat er head during \nmonsoon season. Similarly, the average ground water head of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water head of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water head during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) The average of the maximum and minimum of stream stage during monsoon \nseason is considered as the stream discharge during monsoon season . And \nsimilarly the average between the maximum and minimum stage during non-\nmonsoon season is considered as stream stage during non-monsoon season. \nc) If stream is dry stream, the elevation of the stream bed should be considered as \nthe stream stage.  \nd) These points of stream stage are considered as ground water head points for the \npreparation of contour maps. \ne) The ground water flow from the stream  can be obtained as the product of \nfollowing: \ni) Transmissivity of the aquifer \nii) Length of section \niii) Hydraulic gradient across the section. \niv) Number of days stream recharge takes place during the season. \nf) The Stream Recharge into the assessment sub unit",
    "the aquifer \nii) Length of section \niii) Hydraulic gradient across the section. \niv) Number of days stream recharge takes place during the season. \nf) The Stream Recharge into the assessment sub unit is obtained as the algebraic sum \nof the stream recharge from all the sections. \ng) The stream recharge should be computed for both the seasons. \n12.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nAs per the existing density of network stat ions and the stream stage data , it may be \ndifficult to compute the hydraulic  gradient for each assessment sub unit separately. \nDepending on the availability of network stations and the stream stage data, the estimation \nof hydraulic gradient may be done for  each assessment sub unit, assessment unit or to a \n 196 \ngroup of assessment units. The  computations of  stream recharge in the assessment sub \nunit during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out: \n12.3.1 Average Ground Water Head \nFor knowing the stream recharge in the assessment sub unit the average ground water \nheads for both the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are needed. For computing the \naverage ground water head in any season may be computed as the average of ground \nwater head observed by taking t he ground water head data of at least five years. The \naverage groundwater heads during monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to be \nestimated separately. \n12.3.2 Average Stream Stage \nFor knowing the stream recharge in the assessment sub unit the average stream stage for \nboth the monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are needed. The average stream stage in any \nseason may be computed as the average of maximum and minimum stream stage which \nare in turn average of at least five years data. The average stream stage during monsoon \nseason and non-monsoon season are to be estimated separately. If stream stage data is not \navailable, it can be attempted with only ground water heads, which may reduce th e \naccuracy of the estimate. \n12.3.3 Average Hydraulic Gradient \nHydrau",
    "imated separately. If stream stage data is not \navailable, it can be attempted with only ground water heads, which may reduce th e \naccuracy of the estimate. \n12.3.3 Average Hydraulic Gradient \nHydraulic gradient is the ratio between change in head and the distance between the \nobservation. For computing average hydraulic gradient, water table contour map with \nsuitable contour interval is to be prepared. For preparing this map, stream elevations may \nbe considered as water table data points. The hydraulic gradient at required number of \nplaces can be computed by calculating the head d ifference between contours along the \nflow direction and computing the distance between  both the up and down contours. The \naverage hydraulic gradient for monsoon season and non -monsoon season s are to be \nestimated separately.  \n12.3.4 Stream Recharge \nThe Hydraulic gradient may not be uniform throughout the stream line. Hence it is \nessential to divide the entire stream line into various sections where the hydraulic gradient \nis constant. For each section, the ground water f lows can be estimated by multiplying \nTransmissivity of the aquifer, hydraulic gradient and length of the section. Depending on \nthe direction of flow, the flow should be given sign, positive sign for stream recharge and \nnegative sign for base flows. The stream recharge for monsoon season and non-monsoon \nseason are to be estimated separately.  In this exercise, only stream recharge need to be \ncomputed. \n12.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n12.4.1  Monsoon Season and Non-Monsoon Seasons \nSimilar to the estimation of base flow, in the estimation of stream recharge also there are \nthree possibilities. Depending on the availability of ground water monitoring stations and \nthe alignment of the stream,   the hydraulic gradient can be estimated directly for all sub \n 197 \nunits or for the entire assessment unit or for a group of assessment units. If it is estimated \nfor the total assessment units or group",
    "hydraulic gradient can be estimated directly for all sub \n 197 \nunits or for the entire assessment unit or for a group of assessment units. If it is estimated \nfor the total assessment units or group of assessment units it should be summarised based \non the assessment sub unit to which the recharge is taking place. \nWater Level during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is computed for all the years and \nthe average monsoon season water level and non-monsoon water level is calculated as the \naverage of at least last five years data and is presented in Table 12.1. The computed \naverage water levels during monsoon season and non -monsoon seasons along with \nlatitude and lon gitudes are presented in Table 1 2.2. The stream stage readings during \nmonsoon and non-monsoon seasons is computed for all the years as the average of stream \nstage at the beginning and at the end of the season.T he average monsoon season stream \nstage  and non-monsoon stream stage is calculated as the average of at least last five years \ndata and is presented in Table 12.3. The computed average stream stage during monsoon \nseason and non -monsoon seasons along with latitude and longitudes are presented in \nTable 12.4. \n Using both the water table data and the stream stage data head contour maps are prepared \nin Map 12.1 and Map 12.2 for monsoon season and non -monsoon seasons respectively. \nFrom these maps hydraulic gradient is to be computed for entire stream length. But the \nspacing between the contours vary with space. Hence the entire stream line is divided into \nnumber of sections, such that each section will have equal spacing and in turn same \nhydraulic gradient. Hydraulic gradients are calculated in Table 1 2.5 and Table 12.6 for \nmonsoon season and non-monsoon season respectively. \n Once the hydraulic gradient is computed and length of the section is noted using darcy’s \nlaw stream recharge into the Aquifer during monsoon season is computed in Table 12.7 \nfor command area and Table 12.8 for",
    "raulic gradient is computed and length of the section is noted using darcy’s \nlaw stream recharge into the Aquifer during monsoon season is computed in Table 12.7 \nfor command area and Table 12.8 for non-command area and 12.9 for poor ground water \nquality area. The Stream recharge during non-monsoon season  is computed in Tables \n12.10, 12.11,12.12 respectively for the command area, non -command area and poor \nground water quality.

This is possible only when the unconfined aquifer is underline \nby a semi confined aquifer.  In GEC 1997 methodology, it was advised to carry out the \nground water resources mainly for the unconfined aquifer and where ever feasible to \nassess the res",
    "is underline \nby a semi confined aquifer.  In GEC 1997 methodology, it was advised to carry out the \nground water resources mainly for the unconfined aquifer and where ever feasible to \nassess the resources of confined and/or semi confined a quifer by applying flow concept. \nBut the vertical inter aquifer flow was ignored. In GEC 2015 methodology it was \nsuggested to use volume concept to estimate the ground water resources even in semi -\nconfined and confined aquifers. This also mentions that where ever possible, to estimate \nthe vertical inter aquifer flow. \nFor assessing the vertical inter aquifer flow,  there should be well distributed network of \nground water head  observation wells  in both the aquifers . As other components are \nnormalized in one or other methods, this component also to be estimated for an average \nsituation. Hence there is a requirement of minimum 5 sets of data during pre -monsoon \nand post-monsoon seasons for all the observation wells  in both the aquifers . Except in \nsmall areas where proper demarcation of aquifers is done, the piezometric network  is not \navailable even today. Hence it is advised that aquifer wise network of monitoring stations \nshould be established and monitored for assessing the inter aquifer flow.  \nThe  computations of  vertical inter aquifer flow during a given season involves the \nfollowing steps to be carried out : \na) Computing average ground water head of the unconfined aquifer  and semi -\nconfined aquifer  for both the seasons by taking the ground wate r head data of at \nleast five years. \nb) Computing ground water head of the unconfined aquifer during monsoon and non-\nmonsoon seasons. \nc) Computing piezometric head the semi-confined aquifer during monsoon and non-\nmonsoon seasons. \nd) Preparation of Ground water Table  contours of unconfined aquifer  with suitable \ncontour interval for both the seasons. \ne) Preparation of piezometric contour s of semi -confined aquifer  with suitable \ncontour interval for bo",
    "Table  contours of unconfined aquifer  with suitable \ncontour interval for both the seasons. \ne) Preparation of piezometric contour s of semi -confined aquifer  with suitable \ncontour interval for both the seasons. \nf) Preparation of head difference map for both the seasons. This can be done by GIS \npackages or taking the approximate head difference manually and preparing the \ncontour maps manually \n 214 \ng) Computation of Flow through aquitard for  each of the sub area for both the \nseasons. \nh) Summation of the  flow through aquitard for each of the s ubarea is the resultant \nvertical inter aquifer flow into the unconfined aquifer for both the seasons. \n13.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of vertical inter aquifer flow through the aquitard  are based on the \nfollowing assumptions : \na) The average ground  water head of pre monsoon season and the post monsoon \nseason of the assessment year is considered as the ground water head during \nmonsoon season. Similarly, the average g round water head of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water head of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water head during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) Similarly the piezometric head during monsoon season and non-monsoon seasons \nare computed. \nc) The difference between piezometr ic head of the semi confined aquifer and the \nground water head in the unconfined aquifer at any place is the change in head. If \nobservation wells monitoring both the aquifers are at one place, the computation \nwill be easy  In other cases, i t can be attempte d by taking approximate values \nmanually Otherwise using GIS techniques a map calculation can be applied to \ngenerate the map of head difference. Based on the cont our values different sub \nareas are to be demarcated.  The ground water flow through the aquitard  can be \nestimated using the following formula. \n \nd) Multiplying this with the number of days water flow occurs between these \na",
    "reas are to be demarcated.  The ground water flow through the aquitard  can be \nestimated using the following formula. \n \nd) Multiplying this with the number of days water flow occurs between these \naquifers in a season will give the flow in a particular season.  \ne) The Vertical Inter Aquifer Flow from the assessment sub unit is obtai ned as the \nalgebraic sum of the vertical inter aquifer flow of all the sub areas. \nf) The vertical inter aquifer flow through the aquitard should be computed for both \nthe seasons. \n13.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nFor assessing the vertical inter aquifer flow,  there should be well distributed network of \nground water head observation wells in both the aquifers. If the network is insufficient,  \nit is advised that aquifer wise network of monitoring stations should be established and \nmonitored for assessing the inter aquifer flow. The  computations of  inter aquifer flow to \nor from the aquifer in the assessment sub unit during a given season involves the \nfollowing steps to be carried out : \nAquitardofThickness\nAquitrdoftyConductiviHydraulicdifferenceheadAreaFlowAquiferInterVertival \n 215 \n13.3.1 Average Ground Water Heads in Unconfined and Semi Confined \nAquifers \nFor knowing the most probable inter aquifer flow from/into assessment sub unit the \naverage ground water heads in unconfined aquifer and piezometric heads in semi confined \naquifer for both the monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are needed. The average ground \nwater head or piezometric head in any season may be computed as the average of ground \nwater head or piezometric head respectively of at least five years . The average \ngroundwater heads and piezometric heads  during monsoon season  and non -monsoon \nseason are to be estimated separately. \n13.3.2 Average Head Difference \nTo prepare Average head difference map it is required to have ground water heads in both \nthe aquifers at the same location.

    "To prepare Average head difference map it is required to have ground water heads in both \nthe aquifers at the same location. But normally it is not possible to get like t hat. If they \nare available, the head difference contour map may be prepared easily and can be used in \nthe computation. In the absence of such data, GIS map calculation techniques can be used \nto prepare a difference map between the ground water head maps of semi-confined aquifer \nand unconfined aquifer. From the head difference map, various sub areas are demarcated \nand for each sub area average head difference is marked. This is the average of up contour \nand  down contour values. \n13.3.3 Vertical Inter Aquifer Flow \nFor each of the sub area, the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard, area of the sub area \nand average head difference are multiplied and divided by the  thickness of the aquitard \nto obtain the inter aquifer flow for each of the sub area. It will give the flow per day and \nwhen multiplied with number of days water flow occurs between these aquifers in a \nseason it will give the ground water flow across the aquifers in the particular season. The \ntotal of the inter aquifer flow for all sub areas is the to tal inter aquifer flow into the sub \nunit. \n13.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n13.4.1  Command Area  \nWater Table data of the unconfined aquifer during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is \ncomputed for all the years and the average monsoon season water table  and non-monsoon \nwater table is calculated as the average of at least last five years data and is presented in \nTable 13.1. The computed average water tables during monsoon season and non-monsoon \nseasons along with latitude and long itudes are presented in Table 13 .2. Using the water \ntable data, water table contour maps are prepared in Map 13.1 and Map 13.2 for monsoon \nseason and non -monsoon seasons respectively. Similarly, the average monsoon season \npiezometric head of the semi confined aquifer and non-monsoo",
    "aps are prepared in Map 13.1 and Map 13.2 for monsoon \nseason and non -monsoon seasons respectively. Similarly, the average monsoon season \npiezometric head of the semi confined aquifer and non-monsoon piezometric head of the \nsemi-confined aquifer is calculated as the average of at least last five years data and is \npresented in Table 13.3. The computed average piezometric head during monsoon season \nand non-monsoon seasons along with latitude and longitudes are presented in Table 13.4. \nUsing the piezometric data, piezometric head contour maps are prepared in Map 13.3 and \n 216 \nMap 13.4 for monsoon season and non-monsoon seasons respectively.  Using any of the \nmethods mentioned above, ground water head difference maps are prepared in Map 13.5 \nand Map 13.6. \nOnce the head difference maps are prepared, for each sub area, the inter aquifer flow can \nbe estimated in Table 13.5 and Table 13.6 using the area, thickness of aquitard, hydraulic \nconductivity of the aquitard , average head difference and number of days water flow \noccurs between these aquifers in a season  for monsoon season and non-monsoon season \nrespectively. The head difference in  the difference is between piezometric head  in the \nsemi confined aquifer and  ground water head in unconfined aquifer.  Then the positive \nvalues indicate the flow is into the unconfined aquifer and negative values indicate that \nthe flow is out of unconfined aquifer. \n13.4.2  Non-Command  Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the inter aquifer flow through the \naquitard in the non-command area during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is identical \nto what has been  described earlier in Section 13 .4.1 for the command area. The \ncomputations are presented in  Tables 13.7 to 13.12 and the maps are presented in Maps \n13.7 and 13.12. \n13.4.3  Poor Ground Water Quality Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the inter aquifer flow through the \naquitard in the poor ground water quality a",

As the ground water is no t \nexposed to surface, there is less possibility for evaporation from ground water bodies. But \nin situations where the ground water levels are less than the capillary rise of the aquifer \nmaterial, it will lead to evaporation. If the water levels are shallow and less than the \ncapillary rise, then only evaporation is to be estimated. In all other cases, Evaporation will \nbe zero. In GEC 1997 methodology it is not recommended to estimate this component \nseparately instead there was a provision of unaccounted natural discharges which includes \nbase flow, evaporation and transpiration.  GEC 2015 suggested to compute the \nEvaporation and use in general mass balance equation. \nAs other components are normalized in one or other methods, this component also to be \nestimated for an average situation. Hence there is a requi rement of minimum 5 sets of \nwater level data \nThe  computations of  Evaporation from the ground water reservoir in the assessment sub \nunit during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out : \na) Computing average ground water level for both the seasons by taking the ground \nwater level da",

Similarly, the average ground water level  of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water level of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water level during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) The capillary rise in the area is to be obtained from field studies or literature. In \nthe absence of the same it is considered as 1m. \nc) The Evaporation can be obtained by the following formula for all the  sub areas \nwhere water level is less than capillary rise: \nRiseCapillary\nLevelWaterGroundRiseCapillaryRatenEvaporatioAreanEvaporatio )( \n \nd) If this is multiplied with number of days evaporation takes place during a season \nwill give the evaporation during the season. \ne) The Evaporation from the assessment sub unit is obtained as the sum of the \nevaporation from all the evaporating zones. \nf) The Evaporation should be computed for both the seasons. \n14.3  CO",

The  computations of  Evaporation from the assessment sub unit during a given \nseason involves the following steps to be carried out : \n14.3.1 Average Ground Water Level \nFor knowing the most probable Evaporation from the  assessment sub unit the average \nground water levels for both the m onsoon and non -monsoon seasons are needed. For \ncomputing the average ground water level in any season may be computed as the average \nof ground water level observed by taking the ground water level data of at least five years. \nThe average groundwater levels during monsoon season and non-monsoon season are to \nbe estimated separately. \n14.3.2 Evaporating Area \nFor computing evaporating area, water level contour map with suitable contour interval \nis to be prepared. The area of interest will be the area where water levels are less than the \ncapillary rise. In the absence of capillary rise of the area it should be considered as 1 \nmeter. The evaporating area  for monsoon season  and non -monsoon season s are to be \ndemarcated separately. \n14.3.3 Evaporation  \nThe Evaporation from the assessment sub unit is the total of the evaporation from all the \nevaporating zones. For each evaporating zone, the evaporation can be estimated by the \nfollowing formula. \nRiseCapillary\nLevelWaterGroundRiseCapillaryRatenEvaporatioAreanEvaporatio )( \n \n 255 \nWhen it is multiplied with number of days evaporation takes place in the evaporating \nzone, it gives the evaporation losses from the zone during that particular season.

The \nEvaporation for monsoon season and non-monsoon season are to be estimated separately. \n14.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n14.4.1  Command Area  \nWater Level during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is computed for all the years and \nthe average monsoon season water level and non-monsoon water level is calculated as the \naverage of at least last five years and is presented in Table 1 4.1. The computed average \nwater levels during monsoon season and non-monsoon seasons along with latitude and \nlongitudes are presented in Table 1 4.2. Using the water table data, water level  contour \nmaps are pr epared in Map 14.1 and Map 14 .2 for monsoon season and non -monsoon \nseasons respectively. From these maps Evaporating areas are zoned wherever the water \nlevels are less than the capillary rise. Suitable contour interval may be selected to get \nmore accurate results. The Evaporation is computed in Table 14 .3 and Table 1 4.4  for \nmonsoon season and non-monsoon season respectively.  \n14.4.2  Non-Command  Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the Evaporation in the non -\ncommand area during monso on and non-monsoon seasons is identical to what has been \ndescribed earlier in Section 14.4.1 for the command area. The computations are presented \nin  Tables 14.5 to 14.8 and the maps are presented in Maps 14.3 and 14.4. \n14.4.3  Poor Ground Water Quality Area \nThe computational scheme to be adopted for estimating the Evaporation in the poor \nground water quality area during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is identical to what \nhas been described earlier in Section 14.4.1 for the command area. The computations are \npresented in  Tables 14.9 to 14.12 and the maps are presented in Maps 14.5 and 14.6. \n14.5 STRUCTURE OF DATABASE PROPOSED \nThe following structure is proposed for the data elements pertain to the estimation of \nEvaporation. \n \nS.No Parameter Type Size Decimals \n1 Assessment Sub Unit Text 20  \n2 Evapora",

If the water table is deep below, ground water cannot be wasted \nthrough transpiration. But in the situations where the roots extend up to the capillary rise \nof ground water levels, it wi ll lead to transpiration  as ground water is available to roots \nthrough capillary rise. If the water levels are shallow and less than the capillary rise added \nto the root depth, then only transpiration is to be estimated. In all other cases, transpiration \nwill be zero. In GEC 1997 methodology it is not recommended to estimate this component \nseparately instead there was a provision of unaccounted natural discharges which includes \nbase flow, evaporation and transpiration. GEC 2015 sugg ested to compute the \nTranspiration separately and use in general mass balance equation. \nAs other components are normalized in one or other methods, this component is also to \nbe estimated for an average situation. Hence there is a requirement of minimum 5 sets of \nwater level data \nThe  computations of  Transpiration  from the ground w ater reservoir in the assessment \nsub unit during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out : \na) Computing average ground water level for both the seasons by taking the ground \nwater level data of at least five years data. \nb) Computing the Average Groundwater levels during monsoon se ason and non -\nmonsoon season separately. \nc) Preparation of Ground water level contour with suitable contour interv al \npreferably less than 0.5m for both the seasons. \nd) Demarcating the area in various zones of water level. \ne) Co",
    "arately. \nc) Preparation of Ground water level contour with suitable contour interv al \npreferably less than 0.5m for both the seasons. \nd) Demarcating the area in various zones of water level. \ne) Computation of Transpiration from ground water reservoir for each of the zone \nfor both the seasons. \nf) This transpiration multiplied by the number of days ground water available for \ntranspiration in a season results in Transpiration losses throughout the  particular \nseason. \ng) Summation of the Transpiration  for each of the zones to compute the total \nTranspiration from the assessment sub unit for both the seasons. \n15.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of  Transpiration are based on the following assumptions : \n 276 \na) The average ground water level of pre monsoon season and the post monsoon \nseason of the assessment year is considered as the ground water level during \nmonsoon season. Similarly, the average ground wate r level of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water level of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water level during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) The capillary rise in the area is to be obtai ned from field stud ies or literature. In \nthe absence of the same it is considered as 1m. \nc) The average root depth is to be obtained from the field studies or literature.  In the \nabsence of the same this can be assumed as 2.5m.  \nd) The Transpiration can be obtained by the following formula for all the area where \nwater level is less than the total of root depth and capillary rise: \n)(\n)(\nRiseCapillaryDepthRoot\nLevelWaterGroundRiseCapillaryDepthRootRateionTranspiratAreaionTranspirat \n\n \ne) This transpiration multiplied by the number of days ground water available for \ntranspiration in a season results in Transpiration losses throughout the  particular \nseason. \nf) The Transpiration from the assessment sub un it is obtained as the algebraic sum \nof the transpiration from all the zones",
    "season results in Transpiration losses throughout the  particular \nseason. \nf) The Transpiration from the assessment sub un it is obtained as the algebraic sum \nof the transpiration from all the zones. \n \n15.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nFor computing the Transpiration, the data from all the existing network station s should \nbe used. The  computations of  Transpiration from the assessment sub unit during a given \nseason involves the following steps to be carried out : \n15.3.1 Average Ground Water Level \nFor knowing the most probable Transpiration from the  assessment sub unit the average \nground water levels for both the monsoon and non -monsoon seasons are needed. The \naverage ground water level in any season may be computed as the average of ground \nwater level ob served by taking the ground water level data of at least five years. The \naverage groundwater levels during monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to be \nestimated separately. \n15.3.2 Transpiring Area \nFor computing transpiring area, water level contour map with suitable contour interval is \nto be prepared. The area of interest will be the area where water levels are less than the \ntotal of root depth and capillary rise. In the absence of data on root depth and capillary \nrise of the area it should be considere d as 3.5 meters. The transpiring area for monsoon \nseason and non-monsoon season are to be demarcated separately. \n 277 \n15.3.3 Transpiration  \nThe Transpiration from the assessment sub unit is the total of the transpiration from all \nthe transpiring zones. For each transpiring zone, the transpiration can be estimated by the \nfollowing formula. \n)(\n)(\nRiseCapillaryDepthRoot\nLevelWaterGroundRiseCapillaryDepthRootRateionTranspiratAreaionTranspirat \n\n  \nThis transpiration multiplied by the number of days ground water available for \ntranspiration in a season results in Transpiration losses throughout the  particular season. \nThe Transpiration for monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to",
    "r of days ground water available for \ntranspiration in a season results in Transpiration losses throughout the  particular season. \nThe Transpiration for monsoon season and non -monsoon season are to be estimated \nseparately. \n15.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n15.4.1  Command Area  \nWater Level during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is computed for all the years and \nthe average monsoon season water level and non-monsoon water level is calculated as the \naverage of at least last five years data and is presented in Table 1 5.1. The computed \naverage water levels during monsoon season and non -monsoon seasons along with \nlatitude and longitudes are presented in Table 1 5.2. Using this data, water level contour \nmaps are pr epared in Map 1 5.1 and Map 1 5.2 for monsoon season and non -monsoon \nseasons respectively. From these maps Transpiring areas are zoned wherever the wate r \nlevels are less than the total of root depth and capillary rise. Suitable contour interval may \nbe selected to get more accurate results.

It may \nbe possible to get a single rate of evapotranspiration which is the cumulative effect of \nevaporation and transpiration. In these situations i nstead of using two terms viz. \nevaporation and transpiration in the equation only one term is used i.e. evapotranspiration. \nAs the ground water is not exposed to surface, there is a less possibility for evaporation \nfrom ground water bodies. But in situations where the ground water levels are less than \nthe capillary rise of the aquifer material, it will lead to evaporation. If the water levels are \nshallow and less than the capillary rise, then only evaporation is to be estimated. In all \nother cases, Evaporation will be zero. Similarly  transpiration normally takes place from \nthe ground water reservoir if the roots reach the ground water table. If the water table is \ndeep below, ground water cannot be wasted through transpiration. But in situations where \nthe roots extend up to the capillary rise of ground water levels, it will lead to transpiration. \nIf the water levels are shallow and less t",
    "t be wasted through transpiration. But in situations where \nthe roots extend up to the capillary rise of ground water levels, it will lead to transpiration. \nIf the water levels are shallow and less than the capillary rise added to the root depth, then \nonly transpiration is to be estimated. In all other cases, transpiration will be zero. In GEC \n1997 methodology it is not recommended to estimate this component s eparately instead \nthere was a provision of unaccounted natural discharges which includes base flow, \nevaporation and transpiration. GE C 2015 suggested to compute both  evaporation and \ntranspiration separately and use in general m ass balance equation.  In cas e where the \nevaporation and transpiration rates are not available, it can be assessed by using the \navailable evapotranspiration rates. \nAs other components are normalized in one or other methods, this component also to be \nestimated for an average situation.  Hence there is a requirement of minimum 5 sets of \nwater level data \nThe  computations of  Evapotranspiration from the ground water reservoir in the \nassessment sub unit during a given season involves the following steps to be carried out: \na) Computing average ground water level for both the seasons by taking the ground \nwater level data of at least five years data. \nb) Computing the Average g round water levels during monsoon season and non -\nmonsoon season separately. \nc) Preparation of Ground water level contour with suitable contour interval \npreferably less than 0.5m for both the seasons. \nd) Demarcating the area in various zones of water level. \n 300 \ne) Computation of Evapotranspiration from ground water reservoir for each of the \nzone for both the seasons. \nf) This is multiplied with Number of days evapotranspiration takes place from \nground water reservoir in a season to  compute Evapotranspiration throughout  the \nseason. \ng) Summation of the Evapotranspiration from each of the zones to compute the total \nEvapotranspiration from th",
    "ound water reservoir in a season to  compute Evapotranspiration throughout  the \nseason. \ng) Summation of the Evapotranspiration from each of the zones to compute the total \nEvapotranspiration from the assessment sub unit for both the seasons. \n16.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe computations of  Evapotranspiration are based on the following assumptions : \na) The average ground water level of pre monsoon season and the post monsoon \nseason of the assessment  year is considered as the ground water level during \nmonsoon season. Similarly, the average ground water level of the post monsoon \nseason of the current assessment year and ground water level of the pre monsoon \nseason of the next assessment year is considered as the ground water level during \nnon-monsoon season.  \nb) The capillary rise in the area is to be obtained from field studies or literature. In \nthe absence of the same it is considered as 1m. \nc) The average root depth is to be obtained from the field studies or literature.  In the \nabsence of the same this can be assumed as 2.5m.  \nd) The Evapotranspiration can be obtained by the following formula for all the area \nwhere water level is less than the total of root depth and capillary rise: \n)(\n)(\nRiseCapillaryDepthRoot\nLevelWaterGroundRiseCapillaryDepthRootRatepirationEvapotransAreapirationEvapotrans \n\n \ne) This is multiplied with Number of days evapotranspiration takes place from \nground water reservoir in a season to  compute Evapotranspiration throughout  the \nseason. \nf) The Evapotranspiration from the assessment sub unit is obtained as the al gebraic \nsum of the evapotranspiration from all the zones. \n \n16.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nFor computing the Evapot ranspiration, the data from all the existing network stations \nshould be used. The  computations of   Evapotranspiration from the assessment sub unit \nduring a given season involves the following steps to be carried out : \n16.3.1 Average Ground Water Level \nFor knowing the most probable Evapot ranspir",
    "Evapotranspiration from the assessment sub unit \nduring a given season involves the following steps to be carried out : \n16.3.1 Average Ground Water Level \nFor knowing the most probable Evapot ranspiration from the  assessment sub unit the \naverage ground water levels for both the monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are needed. \nFor computing the average ground water level in any season may be computed as the \naverage of ground water level observed by taking the ground water level data of at least \n 301 \nfive years. The average groundwater levels during monsoon seaso n and non -monsoon \nseason are to be estimated. \n16.3.2 Area Where Evapotranspiration Takes place \nFor computing the area where evapotranspiration takes place , water level contour map \nwith suitable contour interval is to be prepared. The area of interest will be the area where \nwater levels are less than the total of root depth and capillary rise.

These are  \nlisted below: \na) Lateral Flow Along the aquifer system or through flow \nb) Base flow  \nc) Stream Recharge \nd) Vertical Inter Aquifer Flow  \ne) Evaporation \nf) Transpiration \ng) Evapotranspiration \nThe above seven flow components are together referred to as ‘Resultant Flows’. The \nestimation of these components have been presented in Chapters 10 to 16. Resultant flows \nin a given sub -unit is obtained as the algebraic sum of the individual inflow out flow \ncomponents. \nThe estimation of the resultant flows into the assessment unit may be done by taking the \nfollowing few points into consideration. \na) Lateral Flow along the Aquifer System (Through Flow)  : Where ever the \nassessment unit is not hydrological boundary, there will be flow across the \nboundaries. The inflows should be taken as positive and out flows should be taken \nas negative and the resu ltant flow should be computed. Even though the \nassessment unit is a hydrological boundary if the water divide is of low relief, then \nalso there  is a possibility of flow across the boundary. \nb) Base Flow: This is only an outflow, it should be estima",
    "ssment unit is a hydrological boundary if the water divide is of low relief, then \nalso there  is a possibility of flow across the boundary. \nb) Base Flow: This is only an outflow, it should be estimated where ever possible. \nc) Stream Recharge: At any place there is only one possibility that either there will \nbe base flow or there will be stream recharge. Care must be taken for not taking \ninto account the base flow twice. \nd) Vertical Inter aquifer Flow: This flow is p ossible only when the unconfined \naquifer is underlain by a semi confined aquifer. Here also the convention is that \nthe inflow into the unconfined aquifer is considered as positive and outflow from \nthe unconfined aquifer is negative. \ne) Evaporation: If evapora tion and transpiration rates are  available, then this \ncomponent can be estimated and it is always outflow. \nf) Transpiration: If evaporation and transpiration rates are  available, then this \ncomponent can be estimated and it is always outflow. \n 322 \ng) Evapotranspiration: If evaporation and transpiration rates are  not available, then \nthis component can be attempted by knowing the evapotranspiration rate and it is \nalways outflow. In these three components either the evaporation and transpiration \nare estimated separately  or only evapotranspiration is estimated. \nh) Resultant flows  in all the sub-units during the monsoon season of the current \nground water assessment year will be made use of for computing rainfall recharge \nby the water table fluctuation method (Chapter 19).  \n17.2  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION  \nThe resultant flows  are summarised in Tables 17.1 to 17.3, one table for each sub-unit.  \n17.3 STRUCTURE OF DATABASE PROPOSED \nThe following structure is proposed for the data elements pertain to the estimation of \nResultant Flows. \nS.No Parameter Type Size Decimals \n1 Assessment Sub Unit Text 20  \n2 Total Sub Unit Monsoon Lateral Flows Number 7 0 \n3 Total Sub Unit Non-Monsoon Lateral Flows Number 7 0 \n4 Total Sub",

The \n‘Normal Rainfall’, obtained as the average  rainfall over a sufficiently long number of \nground water years will be therefore the most appropriate basis for computing rainfall \nrecharge. \nThe following two methods can be employed for computing rainfall recharge : \na) Rainfall infiltration factor method \nb) Water table fluctuation method \nThe rainfall infiltration factor method alone needs to be employed in each ground water \nassessment unit for the following cases : \na) command and non-command areas during non-monsoon season \nb) poor ground water quality area during non -monsoon season. If observatio n \nnetwork stations are not available in the sub",
    "owing cases : \na) command and non-command areas during non-monsoon season \nb) poor ground water quality area during non -monsoon season. If observatio n \nnetwork stations are not available in the sub unit, the same method may be \napplied in monsoon season also. \nAs far as possible, the water table fluctuation method is to be employed in each ground \nwater assessment unit for the remaining  cases mentioned below: \na) command area during monsoon season \nb) non-command area during monsoon season \nc) Poor ground water quality are during monsoon season if sufficient monitoring \nnetwork is available. \nEven in the above cases where the recommended method to be employed is the wat er \ntable fluctuation method, it is necessary to compute the rainfall recharge by the rainfall \ninfiltration factor method also, because of one or other of the following reasons : \na) Adequate data on depth to water table during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon \nmonitorings of a ground water year may not be available as a result of which \nthe water table fluctuation method cannot be employed, and only the rainfall \ninfiltration factor method has to be made use of. \nb) The computed rainfall recharge values corresponding to d ifferent monsoon \nseason rainfall values through the use of the water balance approach in the \nwater table fluctuation method may be such that all of them are consistently \nnegative or nearly zero. In such a situation, the water table fluctuation method \n 328 \nhas to be dispensed with, and instead the rainfall infiltration factor method will \nhave to be used. This point will be elaborated in the next chapter. \nc) The rainfall recharge as computed by the water table fluctuation method has to \nbe any way compared with that computed by the rainfall infiltration factor \nmethod and finally  the rainfall recharge during monsoon season will have to \nbe assigned a value on the basis of a set of criteria so as to avoid unreasonably \nhigh or low estimates. This point will be elaborated in th",
    "the rainfall recharge during monsoon season will have to \nbe assigned a value on the basis of a set of criteria so as to avoid unreasonably \nhigh or low estimates. This point will be elaborated in the next chapter. \nThis chapter is concerned with computing rainfall recharge by the rainfall infiltration \nfactor method. The water table fluctuation method will be dealt with in the next chapter. \nThe computational procedure for estimating rainfall rech arge by the rainfall infiltration \nfactor method for the three sub-units of command, non-command and poor ground water \nquality areas during the monsoon as well as non-monsoon seasons essentially comprises \nof the following steps : \na) Estimating the normal monso on and the normal non -monsoon season rainfall \napplicable for the three sub-units  \nb) Deciding on the minimum and maximum threshold values for the estimation. \nc) Assigning a rainfall infiltration factor for the three sub-units  \nd) Computing the rainfall recharge dur ing monsoon as well as non -monsoon \nseasons for the three sub-units using results from ‘a’ , ‘b’and ‘c’ above \n18.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe estimation of rainfall recharge by the rainfall infiltration factor method is based on \nthe following assumptions : \na) The rainfall recharge in a given sub-unit during a given season is considered to \nbe a linear function of only the quantum of rainfall during that season  between \nthe minimum and maximum threshold values. The distribution of rainfall within \nthe season is therefore ignored. \nb) The rainfall recharge during any season i s considered to be nil if the normal \nrainfall is less than or equal to minimum threshold . \nc) The rainfall during any season is considered equal to the maximum threshold if \nthe rainfall is more than maximum threshold . \nd) Rainfall recharge in hectare metres can be computed as the product of the \nfollowing three parameters : \ni) Rainfall infiltration factor as a fraction applicable for the sub-unit under \nconsideration  \nii)  Q",
    "recharge in hectare metres can be computed as the product of the \nfollowing three parameters : \ni) Rainfall infiltration factor as a fraction applicable for the sub-unit under \nconsideration  \nii)  Quantum of normal rainfall above minimum threshold in metres \napplicable for the sub-unit and season   under consideration \niii) Area of the sub-unit under consideration in hectares \ne) The rainfall infiltration factor for the given sub-unit depends only on the major \naquifer in that area. Even though factors like geomo rphology, vegetal cover, \nantecedent moisture status etc., (which may be equally important) have been \nignored primarily because the variation  of  rainfall  infiltration factor in \nquantitative terms with variation in these factors are not widely available  \n 329 \nf) The rainfall recharge factor mentioned in ‘e’ above is to be the assigned a value \non the basis of norms given in Annexure IV. The recommended value given in \nthe norms should be alone made use of  unless, results from documented field \nstudies indicate that a different value can be used. In the latter case also, the \nrainfall infiltration factor assigned should be within the range of the maximum \nand the minimum values as specified in the norms. \n18.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nFor computing the rainfall recharge by rainfall infiltration factor method , the data from \nall the available rain gauge stations should be used. The  computations of  rainfall recharge \nusing rainfall infiltration factor method in the assessment sub unit during a given season \ninvolves the following steps to be carried out : \n18.3.1  Normal Rainfall \nEach state/union Territory has a number of rain gauges for each of which normal monsoon \nand non-monsoon season rainfall values are available. All such rain gauges are assigned \na unique name. Each such rain gauge also has a certain area of influence over  which the \nrainfall as recorded in that rain gauge can be assumed to be uniformly applicable. Those \nrain gauges whi",
    "ned \na unique name. Each such rain gauge also has a certain area of influence over  which the \nrainfall as recorded in that rain gauge can be assumed to be uniformly applicable. Those \nrain gauges which fulfil the condition that, a portion of their respective area of influence \nfall withi n the area under consideration are first identified. The normal rainfall data \npertaining to these identified rain gauges form the basis for estimating the normal \nmonsoon and non-monsoon season rainfall applicable for the area under consideration. \n18.3.2  Threshold Values \nInitial rainfall in any area may not contribute to ground water recharge.  To certain \nquantum of rainfall, the rainfall is sufficient to cater soil moisture needs. This minimum \nvalue is known as minimum threshold value of rainfall for the re charge. Similarly after \ncertain quantum of rainfall, whatever may the rainfall, that rainfall will go as runoff. It \nwill not make any recharge. This maximum value is known as maximum threshold. These \nvalues are to be established for each of the area. But in case these values of not available \nfor any area, 10% of the normal annual rainfall may be considered as Minimum threshold \nvalue and 3000mm may be considered as maximum threshold value.  \n18.3.3  Rainfall Infiltration Factor \nThe rainfall infiltration factor for the sub unit during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons \nare obtained either on the basis of the norms as given in Annexure  IV or on the basis of \nresults from documented field studies. \n18.3.4  Rainfall Recharge \nThe rainfall recharge for any season is calculated using the following formula . \nAreaRFIFthresholdmumallRaechallRa **)mininf(argReinf \n \nIn the above equation, if rainfall is more than maximum threshold then instead of actual \nrainfall only maximum threshold value is taken. \n 330 \n18.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n18.4.1 Command Area \nThe location details of the rain gauge stations existing in the sub unit are presented in \nTable 18.1.",

The water table fluctuation method is based on a wat er \nbalance approach in which, all the components of  the water balance equation  are used. \nThe only component which is considered to be unknown is the rainfall recharge. Another \nmajor component in the water balance equation is the change in ground water storage \nduring the monsoon season and this is to be estimated in this chapter.   The estimation of \nthis particular component requires the use of th e w ater table fluctuation due to the \nmonsoon. It is for this reason that, the method has always been somehow referred to as \nthe  water table fluctuation method. A more appropriate name for the method could  \nhowever, have been, ‘Rainfall Recharge by Ground Water Balance Method’. \nThe computational procedure in the application of the water table fluctuation method for \nestimating rainfall recharge during the monsoon season involves the following steps to \nbe carried out :  \na) Computing the monsoon season rainfall duri ng the current ground water \nassessment  year as applicable to the sub-unit. \nb) Computing the water table fluctuation during the monsoon season of the \ncurrent ground water assessment year as applicable to the sub-unit. \nc) Assigning the specific yield value applicable to the sub-unit. \nd) Application of water balance equation to compute the rainfall recharge during \nmonsoon season of the current ground water assessment year, i.e., \ncorresponding to the monsoon season rainfall of the current ground wate",
    "ter balance equation to compute the rainfall recharge during \nmonsoon season of the current ground water assessment year, i.e., \ncorresponding to the monsoon season rainfall of the current ground water \nassessment year. \ne) Application of a normalisation proc edure to compute the rainfall recharge \nduring monsoon season corresponding to the normal monsoon season rainfall \napplicable for the sub-unit. \nf) Compare the estimate of rainfall recharge corresponding to normal monsoon \nseasons rainfall as obtained in 'e' above with estimate of rainfall recharge \nobtained by the rainfall infiltration factor method and finally based on a set of \ncriteria estimate  the rainfall recharge during monsoon season in the sub units \nof the ground water assessment unit. This is done to avoid unreasonably high \nor low estimates of rainfall recharge. \n 346 \n19.2  ASSUMPTIONS \na) The water balance approach followed in the method is essentially a lumped \nparameter approach. Hence, the spatial variations of individual components in \nthe water balance equation are not considered, and only a single lumped value \nof each component for the sub-unit as a whole is considered. \nb) The specific yield of a particular sub-unit  is to be assigned a value on the basis \nof the set of norms given in Annexure V. The recommended value specified in \nthe norms alone are to be used, unless results from pump tests (each being of \nduration not less than 1000 minutes) indicate that a different value can be used. \nIn the latter case also, the specific yield  which is assigned should be within the \nrange of  the maximum and minimum values as specified in the norms. These \nnorms also assume that the specific yield depends only on the Major aquifer of \nthe sub unit. \nc) The rainfall recharge is considered as a linear function  of rainfall while \ncarrying out the normalisation procedure for estimating  the rainfall recharge \nduring monsoon season corresponding to the normal monsoon season rainfall  \nas applicable to",
    "unction  of rainfall while \ncarrying out the normalisation procedure for estimating  the rainfall recharge \nduring monsoon season corresponding to the normal monsoon season rainfall  \nas applicable to the sub-unit. \n19.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \nFor computing the rainfall recharge by water table fluctuation method , the data from all \nthe available rain gauge stations and ground water monitoring stations s hould be used. \nThe  computations o f  rainfall recharge using water table fluctuation method in  the \nassessment sub unit during monsoon season involves the following steps to be carried out \n: \n19.3.1  Water Table Fluctuation \nAll the ground water monitoring stations which represent the sub unit are to be considered \nfor computing the average fluctuation during the current assessment year as well as for \nthe previous ground water years. \n19.3.2  Specific Yield \nThe specific yield for the sub unit during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons are obtained \neither on the basis of the norms as given in Annexure  V or on the basis of results from \ndocumented field studies. \n19.3.3  Change in Storage \nThe change is storage  during monsoon season is calculated using the following formula \nnFluctuatioTableWaterYieldSpecificAreaStorageinChange \n \nThis change in storage is not only because of the rainfall recharge but also due to recharge \nfrom other sources and the resultant inflows and it has  the influence of Gross ground \nwater extraction. Hence to calculate the rainfall recharge there is a need to  apply ground \nwater balance equation. \n 347 \n19.3.4  Ground Water Balance \nTo compute the rainfall recharge during Monsoon season the ground water balance \nequation to be applied. In this equation if all the other parameters are known, the rainfall \nrecharge can be estimated. It can be done using the following equations for Command \narea and non -command areas respectively. The same equation used for command area \ncan be used for poor ground water quality area also. \nThe gro",
    "can be done using the following equations for Command \narea and non -command areas respectively. The same equation used for command area \ncan be used for poor ground water quality area also. \nThe ground water balance equation for command areas an d poor ground water quality \nareas is as given below: \nRRF= h x Sy x A - RSTR - RC- RSWI- RGWI-RTP -RWCS±VF ±LF +GE +T +E + B \n \nThe ground water balance equation for non-command areas is as given below: \n \nRRF= h x Sy x A -RSTR -RSWI- RGWI- RTP - RWCS± VF ± LF + GE + T + E + B \n \nWhere, \n∆h - rise in water level in the monsoon season  \nA - area for computation of recharge   \nSy - Specific Yield \nRRF – Rainfall recharge  \nRc – Recharge from canals \nRSTR- Recharge from streams \nRSWI – Recharge from surface water irrigation including lift irrigation \nRGWI- Recharge from ground water irrigation \nRTP- Recharge from tanks & ponds \nRWCS – Recharge from water conservation structures \nVF – Vertical inter aquifer flow  \nLF- Lateral flow along the aquifer system (through flow) \nGE-Ground water Extraction \nT- Transpiration \nE- Evaporation \nB-Base flow \nThe above equations can be simplified as below: \nExtraction GrossFlowsResultant - sourcesother   todue Recharge-Storagein  ChangeRecharge Rainfall \n \n19.3.5  Normalisation Procedure \nThe rainfall recharge computed through the water balance approach as described in the \nprevious section corresponds to the monsoon season rainfall of the current ground water \nassessment year. Similar computations made earlier for other previous ground water  \nassessment years will have given estimates of rainfall recharge corresponding to the \nmonsoon season rainfall of those respective ground water assessment years. All of them \ntogether result in a set of ordered pairs of data on monsoon season rainfall and th eir \n 348 \nassociated rainfall recharge. Each time a ground water assessment is made, one pair of \ndata on monsoon season rainfall and its associated recharge gets added to this set.  \nThe norma",
    "nd th eir \n 348 \nassociated rainfall recharge. Each time a ground water assessment is made, one pair of \ndata on monsoon season rainfall and its associated recharge gets added to this set.  \nThe normalisation procedure is one in which the set of ordered pairs of data are  used to \nestimate the rainfall recharge during monsoon season for the area corresponding to the \nnormal monsoon season rainfall applicable to it. The rainfall recharge thus estimated after \ncarrying out the normalisation procedure is referred to as the rainfall recharge in the area \nduring monsoon season by the water table fluctuation method. The following scheme can \nbe followed to carry out the normalisation procedure: \na) If the set of ordered pairs of data are such that all the rainfall recharge values \nare negative or nearly zero, the water table fluctuation method is dispensed \nwith, and the rainfall recharge in the area during monsoon season is adopted as \nthe one obtained by the rainfall infiltration factor method.  \nb) From among the set of ordered pairs of data, all those pairs in which the rainfall \nrecharge values are negative or nearly zero are eliminated, and only the \nremaining pairs of data are used for further computations in the normalisation \nprocedure.  \nc) The deviation of each monsoon season rainfall (for which the recharge has been \ncomputed) from the normal monsoon season rainfal l as a percentage of the \nlatter is to be computed. A monsoon season rainfall is normal if the deviation \nas defined above is between +20% and -20%. However, if the deviation is less \nthan -20%, the associated monsoon season rainfall is below normal, and if \ndeviation is greater than +20%, the associated monsoon season rainfall is above \nnormal. It is ideal that the set of ordered pairs of data contain some monsoon \nseason rainfall values wh ich are above normal, and some others which are \nbelow normal. This will ensure th at, the normalisation procedure, which is \nsome form of interpolation, is mor",
    "some monsoon \nseason rainfall values wh ich are above normal, and some others which are \nbelow normal. This will ensure th at, the normalisation procedure, which is \nsome form of interpolation, is more accurate. \nd) With the rainfall recharge ordered pairs data, two methods can be followed for \nthe normalisation procedure.  \ne) The first method which is relatively more simple allows rainfall recharge for \nnormal monsoon season rainfall to be obtained directly from each pair of \nrainfall and recharge data. This method can be therefore followed even if only \none ordered pair of  rainfall and recharge data is available. If more than one \npair of data are available, the rainfall recharge corresponding to normal \nmonsoon season rainfall can be calculated for each pair, and an average of those \nvalues can be then obtained.  \nf) The second method involves application of linear regression analysis. Though \nthis method can  be  theoretically applied even if the number of ordered pairs \nof data,  is only two, it is recommended that, this method should be made use \nof only if  the data pairs are  greater than or equal to 5. The linear regression \nanalysis makes use of the pairs of data on monsoon season rainfall, r(i) and its \nassociated rainfall recharge R(i). In order to avoid handling  numbers with large \nmagnitude, the rainfall, r(i) is expressed  in metres (with  an accuracy of 3 \n 349 \ndecimal places), and the recharge, R(i) is expressed in thousand hectare metres \n(with an accuracy of 3 decimal places).  \n19.3.6  Rainfall Recharge \nThe water table fluctuation method as described above may yield rainfall re charge \nestimates which are either unreasonably high or unreasonably low. This is taken care of \nby: \na) first computing a term P ercent Deviation (PD)  which is the difference \nbetween the rainfall recharge by the water table fluctuation method and that \nby the rai nfall infiltration factor method expressed as  a percentage of the \nlatter \nb) finally assigning a valu",
    "erence \nbetween the rainfall recharge by the water table fluctuation method and that \nby the rai nfall infiltration factor method expressed as  a percentage of the \nlatter \nb) finally assigning a value for the rainfall recharge  during monsoon season in \nthe sub unit on the basis of a set of criteria which depends on the computed \nvalue of PD. \nc) The set of criteria to be adopted in the above scheme are \ni) if PD is greater than or  equal to -20%, and less than or  equal to \n+20%, the rainfall recharge is taken as that obtained by the water \ntable fluctuation method. \nii) if PD is less than -20%, the rainfall recharge is taken as equal to 0.8 \ntimes the value obtained by the rainfall infiltration factor method. \niii) if PD is greater than +20%, the rainfall recharge is taken as equal to \n1.2 times the value obtained by the rainfall infiltration factor method. \n19.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n19.4.1  Command Area \nThe computation of monsoon season rainfall for the current ground water assessment year \nas applicable to the command area is presented in Table 19.1.

Similarly for the previous years based on the data of recharges, \nground water extraction , resultant flows and the change in storage the rainfall recharge \ncan be assessed. This computation is done in Table 19.5. \n The set of ordered pairs of data on monsoon season rainfall and their associated rainfall \nrecharge for the command area is presented in Table 19.6.

Normally the ecological flows will be less than \nthis base flow. In these situations using base flow as ecological flow may result in \nconsidering less resources for the future developmental activities. \nc) The base flow is already subtracted as outflow from the system while computing \nAnnual Ground Water Resource and whenever the base flow is less than the \nEnvironmental Flow, the difference should be subtracted from Total Annual \nGround Water Resource to compute Annual Extractable  Ground Water Resource. \nd) If the Environmental flow is less than base flow, then the difference to be added \nto the Total Annual Ground W ater Resource to compute Annual Extractable  \nGround Water Resource. \ne) If the estimated base flow is equal to the Environmental Flow, then Annual \nExtractable  Ground Water Resource is equal to the  Total Annual Ground Water \nResource. \n 386 \nf) If  the ecological flows are not assessed in an accepted method, then  5 or",

The \nestimation of the trend of wat er table during a given season  and for a given s ub-unit \ncomprises of the following  steps : \na. The depth to water table below ground level as recorded in a number of \nobservations wells within the sub-unit are made use of to obtain the depth to water \ntable information applicable for the sub-unit as a whole. \nb. The results from ‘a’ above are used in a scheme of  linear regression analysis to \nestablish the trend of water table. \nc. Based on the criteria set, the validation of the stage of ground water extraction is \nassessed. \n23.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe estimation of  the trend of water table is based on the following  assumptions: \na) The variation of depth to water table below ground level over successive ground \nwater  years is linear.  Let  x  be successive years, and  y  be the depth to water \ntable below ground level in metres. The relation between  x and y is, \ny = ax + b \nwhere ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the regress",
    "ater  years is linear.  Let  x  be successive years, and  y  be the depth to water \ntable below ground level in metres. The relation between  x and y is, \ny = ax + b \nwhere ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the regression constants  \nb) The value of ‘a’ obtained by linear regression analysis multiplied by 100 gives the \ntrend of depth to water table below ground level in cm per year. Let this be  \ndesignated as ‘Z’. The water table shows a falling trend if ‘Z’ is positive and rising \ntrend if ‘Z’ is negative. The absolute value of 'Z' gives the rise or fall of water \ntable  in cm per year. \nc) As discussed in ‘a’ above, the water table shows a neither rising nor falling trend \nonly if ‘Z’ is equal to zero. However, from a practical point of view it is necessary \nto adopt a range of values for ‘Z’ within which the water table can be considered \nto show a neither rising nor falling trend. With this considerati on in mind, the \n 397 \nwater table trend is assumed to be  rising or falling or neither rising nor falling \nbased on the critical value decided by the state government for this purpose. \nd) When the stage of ground water extraction is less than 70% , there should not be  \ndeclining trends in both the seasons. There can be one declining trend in any of \nthe seasons. \ne) Similarly when the stage of ground water extraction is more than 100%, there \nshould not be rising trends in both the seasons. There can be one rising trend in \nany of the seasons. \n23.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE  \n23.3.1  Water Table Information  \nUnprocessed data on depth to water table below ground level during pre -monsoon  and \npost-monsoon measurements for at least five years prior to the ground water assessment \nyear is required to calculate the ground water level trends of the assessment sub unit.  If \nthere are more than one well any of the averaging techniques to be used to compute a \nsingle value for each season for each year representing the entire area of assess ment sub \nunit. \n23.3.2  Water Table  Tre",
    "more than one well any of the averaging techniques to be used to compute a \nsingle value for each season for each year representing the entire area of assess ment sub \nunit. \n23.3.2  Water Table  Trend during Any Season \nThe depth to water table below ground water level applicable for the sub unit during any \nseason for at least previous five years are used in the linear regression analysis for \nestimating the water table trend during  that particular season for that sub unit. \nThe application of linear  regression analysis  requires a set of ordered  pairs of data on x \n(i) and y(i) for i = 1 to N, where ‘N’ refers to the number of pairs of data,  x(i) refers to \nthe year and y(i) refers to the depth to water table below ground level during any season. \nThe value of x(i) for i = 1 is 1, and this corresponds to the earliest ground water year for \nwhich water table data is available. If  water table data is available for the next ground \nwater year, the value of x(i) for i = 2 is 2. However, if water table data is available only \nafter a gap of one ground water year, the value of x(i) for i = 2 is 3. A similar procedure \nis followed and the complete set of ordered pairs of data on  x(i) and y(i) are obtained and \nan equation is fit for the relation. \n23.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n23.4.1  Command Area \nLocation details and availability of water table data of all observation wells in the \ncommand  area  of  the  ground  water  assessment unit  are presented in Table 23.1.

But \nwith the existing network of quality monitoring, it is not possible to categorize the area. \nThere are so many problems in respect to type of attributes also. Some of the attributes \nare point data which can be considered as varying linearly between two points. Hence it \nwas decided to add a quality tag to the assessment sub unit. The major sources of quality \nconcern are salinity, fluoride and arsenic. It can vary depending on the area also. If the \nparticular parameter is influencing an area in mappable units then the parameter should \nbe tagged to the assessment sub unit. \n24.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nEven some of the pa rameters are point sources if it occurs in two nearby areas, it is \nassumed that the area intervening these two sample sites is affected by that parameter. If \nthose patches of contamination or quality deterioration is mappable in 1:2,50,000 scale as \nof now may be considered for tagging. Quality tag should  be as follows:This sub unit has \nF, As, salinity contamination in Mappable units. Otherwise the quality tag will be Fresh. \n24.3  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \nThe data pertains to  quality tagging in all sub units are presented in Table 24.1 .. \n24.4 STRUCTURE OF DATABASE PROPOSED \nThe following structure is proposed for the data elements pertain to the Quality tagging. \n \nS.No Parameter Type Size Decimals \n1 Assessment Su",

There is therefore, a need to provide a certain allocation  \nof ground water for domestic water supply so that, the demands for the domestic purposes \nare ensured before planning any future ground water development to meet the demands \nof other purposes like irrigation and industrial purpose .  \nUnlike irrigation water requirement which primarily depends on the availability of \nirrigable land, the requirement for domestic water supply depends on the  population. It \nis a lso preferable that, a projected population say as on 20 25, and not the current \npopulation is considered, while arriving at the annual allocation for domestic water \nsupply. \nThe following",
    "It \nis a lso preferable that, a projected population say as on 20 25, and not the current \npopulation is considered, while arriving at the annual allocation for domestic water \nsupply. \nThe following factors are important for arriving at an estimate for the annual allo cation \nof ground water to meet domestic water requirements.  \na) extent of dependency on ground water  \nb) per capita per day requirement of water \nc) criteria for population projection \nThe above factors are likely to vary considerably from State to State, and even within a \nState. In other words, the estimation of allocation  for domestic water supply is highly \nlocation specific. Consequently, each State/ Union Territory is given a freedom to arrive \nat the estimate of the annual allocation on the basis of any procedure most suitable to \nthem. The only requirement is that, the annual allocation of ground water for domestic \nwater supply should be arrived at for the all the sub-units in each ground water assessment \nunit with as much reliability as possible. The dependency on ground water in a poor \nground water quality area may be zero.  \nThe report on “Ground Water Estimation Methodology -2015” however, suggests a \nprocedure which can be made use for estimating the annual allocation of ground water \nfor domestic water supply. This procedure which is described in the next section can be \nadopted if it is found suitable and if a better procedure is not available. \n \n 418 \n25.2  ASSUMPTIONS \nThe  Allocation for future domestic needs may be obtained by the following formula \nY = 22 * N * Lg \nwhere, \nY is allocation for domestic water supply per unit area in mm/ year  \nN is projected population density in thousands per sq.km. \nThis formula assumes that the percapita requirement for domestic needs is 60liters/day. \n25.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE  \nThe report on “Ground water Estimation Methodology - 2015” recommends that the \nallocation for domestic water supply per unit area can be arrived at using th",
    "ters/day. \n25.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE  \nThe report on “Ground water Estimation Methodology - 2015” recommends that the \nallocation for domestic water supply per unit area can be arrived at using the following  \nequation in which it is assumed that, the requirement for domestic water supply is  60 \nlpcd (litres per capita per day). \nY = 22 * N * Lg  \nwhere, \nY is allocation for domestic water supply per unit area in mm/ year  \nN is projected population density in thousands per sq.km. \n25.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \nThe computations as recommended by GEC 2015 for all the sub units is presented in \nTable 25.1.

These are termed \nas Additional Potential Ground Water Resources. In any ground water assessment unit \nthere can be some area which is inf",
    "unit  where there is a potential of ground water development. These are termed \nas Additional Potential Ground Water Resources. In any ground water assessment unit \nthere can be some area which is influe nced by number of springs. Even though this is a \npart of dynamic resource which is replenishable in nature, it is c onsidered as potential \nresource because of the paucity of data in a national perspective, the other two potential \nresources are the ground water available in areas which are under waterlogged or shallow \nwater table conditions and area under flood prone conditions. \nSpring discharge constitutes an additional source of ground water in hilly areas which \nemerges at the places where ground water leve l cuts the surface topography. The spring \ndischarge is equal to the ground water recharge minus the outflow through evaporation , \ntranspiration and vertical & lateral sub-surface flow. Thus, Spring Discharge is a form of \n‘Annual Extractable Ground Water Res ource’. It is a renewable resource. Spring \ndischarge measurement is to be carried out by volumetric measurement of discharge of \nthe springs. Spring discharges multiplied with time in days of each s eason will give the \nquantum of spring resources available during that season.  \n In the water logged & shallow water table conditions and flood prone conditions , the \nrejected discharge will be considerable, and the water table fluctuation will also be \nsubdued. The computation of rainfall recharge considering the water table fluctuation data \nis therefore likely to lead to an underestimation of the recharge in all such areas of the \nground water assessment unit. It is also always desirable that, the ground water table in \nsuch areas should be lowered down to an acceptab le optimum level before the \ncommencement of the monsoon so as to provide additional scope for recharge from \nrainfall  during the monsoon season. The additional potential resource is considered as \nthe ground water resource available",
    "cement of the monsoon so as to provide additional scope for recharge from \nrainfall  during the monsoon season. The additional potential resource is considered as \nthe ground water resource available above 5m below the groun d surface in the water \nlogging and shallow water table areas . In the flood prone areas , the recharge which is \ntaking place by the inundation of the area.  In case of springs, the component of ground \n 426 \nwater which is available as a free flow due to the springs during the year is considered as \npotential resource. \n27.2  ASSUMPTIONS \n27.2.1  Spring Discharges  \nThe assumptions in computing potential resource due to spring discharges are as follows: \na) Spring discharges are assumed to be constant throughout the season. \nb) It is also assumed that it exists throughout the season with the same discharge. \nc) The spring discharge for any season is the average of the spring discharges \nmonitored during the season. \nd) Potential resource due to spring discharges is estimated as the produc t of the \nfollowing parameters \ni) Average discharge during the season \nii) No of days the spring yields during the season \n27.2.2  Waterlogged and Shallow Water Table Areas  \na) Waterlogged and shallow water table areas are characterised by depth to water \ntable below ground level being less than 5 meters \nb) The potential resource in hectare meters can be computed as the product of the \nfollowing three parameters \ni) Area in hectares \nii) Specific yield of the aquifer in  the zone up to 5 meters below ground level \niii) Difference between the actual average depth to water table below ground \nlevel in meters and the optimum limit of  5 meters mentioned in ‘a’ above \n27.2.3  Flood Prone Area \na) Potential recharge in flood prone area depends on several factors like, \ni) Area inundated \nii) Retention period of the flood  \niii) Soil strata in the flood prone area  \niv) Silt load  in the river which gets deposited in the flood prone area.  \nb) The collection of",
    "ke, \ni) Area inundated \nii) Retention period of the flood  \niii) Soil strata in the flood prone area  \niv) Silt load  in the river which gets deposited in the flood prone area.  \nb) The collection of data on all these factors is usually very difficul t, and hence, \npotential resource in flood prone area is computed on the same basis adopted for \ncomputing recharge from tanks and ponds as described earlier in Chapter 7. \nc) The potential resource is calculated as the product of the following three \nparameters \ni) Area of inundation \nii) Recharge factor same as considered for Tanks/ponds \niii) No of days of inundation \n \n 427 \n27.3  COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE \n27.3.1  Spring Discharges  \nThe computational procedure for estimating the potential re source due to spring \ndischarges within the ground water assessment unit involves the following steps : \na) The identification of springs in the area which are yielding sufficiently and for \nsufficient number of days. \nb) The discharges of the springs are to be monitored as many number of times as \npossible so as to assess the resources more accurately. \nc) The minimum number of monitoring of springs as suggested by GEC 2015 is four \nin accordance with the water level monitoring viz. Pre monsoon, mid monsoon, \npost monsoon, mid non monsoon seasons. \nd) The potential resource due to spring discharges (Y) can be computed in hectare \nmeters as  \n100001000\n days of No 24 x60lpmin  Discharge Spring Average\n\nY\n \n27.3.2  Waterlogged and Shallow Water Table Areas  \nThe computational procedure for estimating the potential re source in hectare met ers in \nthe  waterlogged and shallow water table areas within the ground water assessment unit   \ninvolves the following steps : \na) The portions of the ground water assessment unit characterised by \nwaterlogged and shallow water table conditions are identified, and the \narea  and the average depth to water table below ground level of those  \nportions are obtained. Let the area in hectares b",
    "d by \nwaterlogged and shallow water table conditions are identified, and the \narea  and the average depth to water table below ground level of those  \nportions are obtained. Let the area in hectares be ‘A’, and the depth to \nwater table below ground level in meters be ‘D’ \nb) The specific yield , Sy of the aquifer formation in the zone up to 5 meters \nbelow ground level is obtained \nc) The potential resource in waterlogged and shallow water table areas, ‘Y’ \nin hectare meters is finally computed as  \nY = (5 - D) * A * Sy \nIt also needs to be emphasised that, unlike  the ‘ Annual Extractable Ground Water \nResource’ as presented earlier in Chapter 20  which is available y ear after year, t he \nadditional potential resource in waterlogged and shallow water table areas is a onetime \navailability of ground water which ceases as and when the water table is lowered  down \nto the accepted optimum level of   5  meters below ground level. \n27.3.3  Flood Prone Area \nThe computational procedure for estimating the potential re source in hectare met ers in \nthe flood prone area involves the following steps : \na. The portion within the ground water assessment unit under flood  prone \nconditions is iden tified. The area of this inundation  in hectares, as well as the \n 428 \nnumber  days during a year when  water is retained in it are obtained. Let ‘A’ be \nthe area in hectares, and ‘N’ be the number of days water is retained in a year. \nb. The annual potential re source  ‘Y’, in hectare meters in the flood prone  area \nwithin the ground water assessment unit is finally computed as,  \nY = Recharge Factor For Tanks/Ponds* N * A / 1000. \n27.4  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \n27.4.1  Spring Discharges  \nThe computations for obtaining the average spring discharges for each of the  spring are \npresented in Table 2 7.1.

    "ORAGE  GROUND WATER \nRESOURCES OF UNCONFINED AQUIFER \n \n28.1  GENERAL  \nThe ‘Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource’ as computed earlier in Chapter 20  is \nthe ‘Dynamic’ component of the ground water resource which is available in the zone of  \nwater table fluctuation. All plans for ground water development are made on the basis of \nthis dynamic component which is available year after year. \nThe in-storage ground water resource in a ground water assessment unit can be considered \nto be that which is available below the zone of water table fluctuation upto the bottom of \nthe unconfined aquifer. The in-storage ground water resource, unlike the dynamic ground \nwater resource, is not available year after year. Als o, any development of the in-storage \nground water resource is synonymous to ground water mining. Consequently, the in-\nstorage ground water resource can be considered for development only during periods of \nextreme drought condition, and that too probably only  to meet d rinking water supply. \nThe in-storage ground water resource thus mined, can be expected to be recouped during \nthose forth coming years of excess rainfall. \n28.2  ASSUMPTIONS \na) The in-storage resource is below average pre monsoon water level in the \nassessment area. \nb) If aquifer mapping is completed, the bottom of the aquifer is to be considered for \nthe bottom level for computing this resources.

The first report contains only the  dynamic ground water resources which \ncan be used for planning for future ground water manageme nt. Whereas the other report \nshould contain the total availability of the ground water resources which indicates if there \nis any  ground water mining taking place in the assessment unit  for sensitizing \nstakeholders about the dama",
    "uld contain the total availability of the ground water resources which indicates if there \nis any  ground water mining taking place in the assessment unit  for sensitizing \nstakeholders about the damage being done to the environ ment and for planning the \nremedial measures there upon for rectifying the damage. This table should also be \naccompanied by graphical plots, one for each sub units, which show the trend of depth to \nwater table below ground level during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon monitorings. The \nintentions behind this requirement are many. Some of the more important among them \nare listed below : \na) A comprehensive understanding of the ground water assessment in each ground \nwater assessment unit can be obtained from these concise tables of information  \nb) The first Report on the dynamic ground water resources can be used for planning \nfor future ground water management.  \nc) The second report  on the total availability of the ground water resources indicates \nthe status of ground wa ter mining taking place in the assessment unit which can \nbe used for sensitizing stakeholders about the damage being done to the \nenvironment and for planning the remedial measures there upon for rectifying the \ndamage \nd) The relative importance of each ground water assessment component can be better \nappreciated as a result of which more attention can be focused in the future for \nrefining the methodology for computing those components which are relatively \nmore important  \ne) A concise table of information will be ma de available so that the task of refining \nthe norms adopted in ground water assessment as and when it is undertaken can \nbe more efficiently accomplished. \n 468 \n34.2  FORMATS SUGGESTED FOR THE COMPUTATION \nThe summary report on the dynamic ground water resources assessment for each ground \nwater assessment unit is to be presented in Table 34.1.

    "25 10 \nFor surface water, the recharge is to be estimated based on water released at the outlet.  \nFor ground water, the recharge is to be e stimated based on gross draft. Where continuous \nsupply is used instead of rotational supply, an additional recharge of 5% of application may be \nused.

Other Norms  \n1. Norm Recommended for the Recharge Due To Tanks & Ponds \n \nAs the data on the field studies for computing recharge from Tanks & Ponds are very \nlimited, it is recommended to follow the same norm as  followed in GEC 1997 in future \nassessments also. Hence the norm r ecommended by GEC -2015 for Seepage from Tanks & \nPonds is 1.4 mm / day. \n2. Norm Recommended for the Recharge Due To Water Conservation \nStructures \nAs per the studies carried out by various Non -Government Organizations, GEC-2015 \nrecommends the Norm for the seepage from Water Conservation Structures as 40% of gross \nstorage during a year which means 20% during monsoon season and 20% during non-monsoon \nSeason. \n3. Norm for Percapita Requirement \nGEC 2015 recommends a norm of 60lpcd for computing the Allocation for future \ndomestic needs. But the committee suggests to use the actual requirement if known. \n4.

If  water table fluctuation method  is used for estimating rainfall recharge, 5% of \nthe Annual Ground Water Recharge may be considered as Environmental Flow and if rainfall \ninfiltration method is used for estimating rainfall recharge  then 10% of  the Annual Ground \nWater Recharge may be considered as Environmental flow.                 \n \n 533 \nIV.

Artificial recharge  techniques normally address to following \nissues - \n \n(i) To enhance the sustainable yield in areas where over-development has depleted the \naquifer. \n \n(ii) Conservation and storage of excess surface  water for future requirements, since \nthese requirements often changes within a season or a period. \n \n(iii) To improve the quality of existing ground water through dilution. \n \n(iv) To remove bacteriological and other impur ities from sewage and waste water so \nthat water is suitable for re-use. \n \nThe basic purpose of artificial recharge of  ground water is to restore supplies from \naquifers depleted due to excessive ground water development. \n \n \n1.1        Concept of Augmenting Ground Water Reservoir \n \n1.1.1 Ground Water or Sub-Surface Reservoirs \n \nThe sub-surface reservoirs are",

The su b-surface reservoirs can store substantial \nquantity of water. The sub-surface geolog ical formations may be considered as \n\"warehouse\" for storing water that come from sources located on the land surface. Besides \nsuitable lithological condition, other consider ations for creating sub-surface storages are \nfavourable geological structur es and physiographic units, w hose dimensions and shape \nwill allow retention of substantial volume of water in porous and permeable formations. \n \nThe sub-surface reservoirs, located in suitable hydrogeological situations, are \nenvironment friendly and economically viable  proposition. The sub-surface storages have \nadvantages of being free from the adverse effects like inundation of large surface area, \nloss of cultivable land, displacement of local  population, substantia l evaporation losses \nand sensitivity to earthquakes. No gigantic structures are needed to store water. The \nunderground storage of water would also have  beneficial influence on the existing ground \nwater regime. The deeper water levels in ma ny parts of the country, either of natural \noccurrence or due to excessive  ground water development, may be substantially raised, \nresulting in reduction in lifti ng costs and energy saving. Th e quality of natural ground \n  \n  \n \nwater would substantially improve in brackis h and saline areas.

    "h sub-surface stor age at various surface intersection points in \nthe form of spring line, or stream emergen ce, would enhance the river flows and improve \nthe presently degraded ecosystem of riverine tracts, particularly in the outfall areas. The \nstructures required for rechar ging ground water reservoirs ar e of small dimensions and \ncost effective, such as check dams, percola tion tanks, surface spreading basins, pits, sub-\nsurface dykes etc. \n \n \n1.1.2  Basic Requirement for Arti ficial Recharge Projects \n \nThe basic requirements for recharging the ground water reservoir are: \n \na) Availability of non-committed surplus monsoon run off in space and time. \n \nb) Identification of suitable hydrogeological environment and sites for creating sub-\nsurface reservoir through cost effective artificial recharge techniques. \n \n \n1.1.3  Source Water Availability \n \nThe availability of source water, one of the prime requisites for ground water \nrecharge, is basically assessed in terms of  non committed surplus monsoon run off, which \nas per present water resource development sc enario is going unutilised. This component \ncan be assessed by analysing the monsoon rain fall pattern, its frequency, number of rainy \ndays, maximum rainfall in a day and its variat ion in space and time. The variations in \nrainfall pattern in space and time, and its relevance in relation to the scope for artificial \nrecharge to sub-surface rese rvoirs can be considered fo r assessing the surplus surface \nwater availability. \n \n \n1.1.4 Hydrogeological Aspects \n \nDetailed knowledge of geological and hydrological features of the area is \nnecessary for adequately selecting the site and th e type of recharge structure. In particular, \nthe features, parameters and  data to be considered are: geologi cal boundaries; hydraulic \nboundaries; inflow and outflow  of waters; storage cap acity; porosity; hydraulic \nconductivity; transmissiv ity; natural discharge of springs ; water resources available for \nrechar",
    "aries; hydraulic \nboundaries; inflow and outflow  of waters; storage cap acity; porosity; hydraulic \nconductivity; transmissiv ity; natural discharge of springs ; water resources available for \nrecharge; natural recharge; wa ter balance; lithology; depth of the aquifer; and tectonic \nboundaries. The aquifers best suited for artificial recharge are those aquifers which absorb \nlarge quantities of water and do not release them too quickly. Theoretically this will imply \nthat the vertical hydraulic conductivity is high, while the horizontal hydraulic conductivity \nis moderate. These two conditions are not often encountered in nature.  \n \n  \n  \n \nThe evaluation of the storage potential of sub-surface reservoirs is invariably based \non the knowledge of dimensional data of rese rvoir rock, which includes their thickness \nand lateral extent.  The avai lability of sub-surface storage space and its replenishment \ncapacity further govern the extent of rechar ge. The hydrogeological si tuation in each area \nneeds to be appraised with a view to asse ss the recharge capabilities of the underlying \nhydrogeological formations.  The unsaturated  thickness of rock fo rmations, occurring \nbeyond three meters below ground level should be  considered to assess the requirement of \nwater to build up the sub-surface storage by sa turating the entire thickness of the vadose \nup to 3 m. below ground level. \n \nThe upper 3 m of the unsaturated zone is not considered for recharging, since it \nmay cause adverse environmental impact e.g. water logging, soil salinity, etc. The post-\nmonsoon depth to water level represents a situ ation of minimum thickness of vadose zone \navailable for recharge which can be consider ed vis-a-vis surplus monsoon run off in the \narea. \n \nThe artificial recharge techniques inter re late land integrate the source water to \nground water reservoir.

    "es inter re late land integrate the source water to \nground water reservoir. Two effects are gene rated by artificial rech arge in ground water \nreservoir namely - (a) Rise in water level and (b) increment in the total volume of the \nground water reservoir. \n \n \n2.0  PLANNING OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE PROJECTS \n \n2.1 Identification Area \n \nThe artificial recharge projects are site  specific and even the replication of the \ntechniques from similar areas are to be based on the local hydrogeological and \nhydrological environments. The first step in pl anning the project is to demarcate the area \nof recharge. The Project can be implemente d systematically in case a hydrologic unit like \nwatershed is taken for implementation. Howeve r, localised schemes are also taken to \naugment ground water reservoir. The artificial recharge of ground water is normally taken \nin following areas: \n \n1.        Areas where ground water levels are declining on regular basis. \n2.       Areas where substantial amount of aquifer has already been desaturated. \n3.       Areas where availability of ground water is inadequate in lean months. \n4.       Areas where salinity ingress is taking place. \n \n \n2.2 Scientific Inputs \n   \nIn order to plan the artificial recharge schemes following studies are needed \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n2.2.1 Hydrometeorological Studies   \n \nThese are undertaken to decipher the ra infall pattern, evaporation losses and \nclimatological features.  These can bring out  the extent of evaporation losses in post \nmonsoon period which would be helpful in desi gning the storages of particular capacity \nwith a view to have minimum evaporation losses. In semi arid regions of India, \nevaporation losses are significant after January hence the stored water should percolate to \nground water reservoir by this period.  The data  on rainfall intensity, number of rain-days, \netc. help in deciding the capacity and design of the artificial recharge structures. \n \n \n2.2.2 Hydrological Studies",

The data  on rainfall intensity, number of rain-days, \netc. help in deciding the capacity and design of the artificial recharge structures. \n \n \n2.2.2 Hydrological Studies              \n \nBefore undertaking any artificial recharge project, it is a basic prerequisite to \nascertain the availability of source water for the purpose of recharging the ground water \nreservoir. For determining the source water availability for artificial recharge, hydrological \ninvestigations are required to  be carried out in the Waters hed/Sub-basin/basin where the \nartificial recharge schemes are envisaged. Four  types of source water may be available for \nartificial recharge viz. \n \n(i) Insitu precipitation on the watershed. \n(ii) Surface (canal) supplies from large reservoirs located within basin \n(iii) Surface supplies through trans basin water transfer. \n(iv) Treated municipal and industrial wastewaters. \n \n'In situ' precipitation will be available almo st at every location but may or may not \nbe adequate to cause artificial recharge  but the runoff going unut ilised outside the \nwatershed/ basin can be stored/ transmitte d through simple recharge structures at \nappropriate locations. In addition none, one or both of the other two sources may be \navailable in any of the situations, the following information will be required: \n \na) The quantity that may be diverted for artificial recharge. \nb) The time for which the source water will be available. \nc) The quality of source water and the pretreatment required. \nd) Conveyance system required to bring the water to the recharge site. \n \nHydrological studies are undertaken to work out surplus monsoon run off which \ncan be harnessed as source water for artificial recharge. \n \n \n2.2.3  Soil Infiltration Studies  \n \nIn case of artificia l recharge through water spreading methods, soil and Land use \nconditions which control the rate of infiltr ation and downward percolation of the water \napplied on the surface of the soil as",
    "artificia l recharge through water spreading methods, soil and Land use \nconditions which control the rate of infiltr ation and downward percolation of the water \napplied on the surface of the soil assume special importance. Infiltration in its most narrow \nand precise sense can be defined as \"The process water entering into a soil through the soil \n  \n  \n \nsurface\". Although a distinction is made be tween infiltration and percolation (the \nmovement of water within the soil) th e two phenomena are closely related since \ninfiltration cannot continue unimpeded unless percolation removes in filtrated water from \nthe surface soil. The soil is permeated by non capillary channel through which gravity \nwater flows downward towards the ground water, following the path of least resistance. \nCapillary forces continuously divert gravity water into  pore spaces, so that the quantity of \ngravity water passing successively lower horizons  is steadily diminished. This leads to \nincreasing resistance to gravity flow in the surface layer and a decreasing rate of \ninfiltration as a storm progresses. The rate of infiltration in the early phases of a storm is \nless if the capillary pores are filed from a previous storm. \n \nThere is maximum rate at which water can enter soil at a particular point under a \ngiven set of conditions, this rate is called th e infiltration capacity. The actual infiltration \nrate equals the infiltration capacity only when the supply rate rainfall intensity less rate of \nretention) equals or exceeds. \n \nInfiltration capacity depends on many factors such as soil type, moisture content, \norganic matter, vegetative cover, season, ai r entrapment, formation of surface seals or \ncrusts etc. Of the soil ch aracteristics affecting infiltra tion, non-capillary porosity is \nperhaps the most important. Porosity dete rmines storage capacity and also effects \nresistance to flow. Thus infiltration tends  to increase with porosity. Vegetal cover \nincreases infiltration as co",
    "perhaps the most important. Porosity dete rmines storage capacity and also effects \nresistance to flow. Thus infiltration tends  to increase with porosity. Vegetal cover \nincreases infiltration as compared with ba rren soil because (i) it retards surface flow \ngiving the water additional time to enter the so il (ii) the root system make the soil more \npervious and (iii) the foliage shields the so il from raindrop impact and reduces rain \npacking of surface soil. As water infiltrate s soil under natural condi tions the displacement \nof air is not complete even after many hours. Air spaces in the soil and intermediate zones \ninterfere with infiltration as air is not pushe d out by the infiltrating water but is gradually \nabsorbed by water. Due to this phenomena infiltration rate may start rising towards a new \nhigh after a few days of continuous applic ation of water. Surface conditions have a \nmarked effect on the infiltration process and the formation of surface seals or crusts which \nforms under the influence of external forces such as rain drop impact and mechanical \ncompaction or through staking reduces the rate of infiltration. \n \nInfiltration of wate r through surface takes place ge nerally over small periods of \ntime and it is the process of redistribution of the soil water that goes on for most of the \ntime and therefore predominates. When ra infall ceases the water wetted during the \ninfiltration process starts to drain with th e soil being wetted lower down the profile. The \nsoil water conditions during the distribution periods are therefore those that primarily \ninfluence plant growth and agricultural husband ry and that also provide the buffer action \nin hydrologic cycle that the soil water zones has on the transport of water from the soil \nsurface to the ground water aquifer. As such, inf iltration is critically inter-linked with the \nphenomena of water evolution in the vadose zone which includes wetting front \npropagation. \n \n In order to know infiltra",

Cylinder \nor flood infiltro-meters are common type of instruments which measure the infiltration as \n  \n  \n \nthe rate of water leaving the de vice.   Map showing infiltration rates of soils are prepared.  \nThese help to design suitable artificial rechar ge structures and to assess the extent of \nrecharge from these structures. \n \n \n2.2.4 Hydrogeological Studies  \n \nA correct understanding of  hydrogeology of an area is of prime importance in \nsuccessful implementation of any Artificial Rech arge scheme. A desirabl e first step is to \nsynthesize all the available data on hydrogeolog y from different agencies. The regional \ngeological maps indicate the location of differ ent geological strata, their geological age \nsequence, boundaries/contacts of individual form ations and the struct ural expressions like \nStrike, Dip, Faults, Folds, Flexures, Intrusive bodies etc.  These maps also bring out \ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts. \n \nThe Map providing information on region al hydrogeological rock units, their \nground water potential and general pattern of ground water flow and chemical quality of \nwater in different aquifers are necessary. \n \nSatellite Imagery maps provides useful data on geomorphic units and lineaments \nwhich govern the occurrence and movement of ground water. \n \nA detailed hydrogeological study besides the regional picture of hydrogeological \nset up available from previous studies is th erefore imperative to know precisely the \npromising hydrogeological units for recharge and correctly decide on the location and type \nof structures to be constructed in field. \n \nThe hydrogeological investigations required before implementation of an artificial \nrecharge scheme are given b",
    "correctly decide on the location and type \nof structures to be constructed in field. \n \nThe hydrogeological investigations required before implementation of an artificial \nrecharge scheme are given below. \n \n(i) Detailed Hydrogeological Mapping \nThe purpose of hydrogeological mapping is to present the following maps which \nfacilitate in the analysis of the ground water re gime and its suitability to artificial recharge \nschemes. \n \na) Map showing hydrogeological units demarcated on the basis of their water bearing \ncapabilities, both at shallow and deeper levels. \nb) Map showing ground water contours to determine the form of the water table and \nthe hydraulic connection of ground water with rivers, canals etc. \nc) Map showing the depths to the water tabl e are usually compiled for the periods of \nthe maximum, minimum and mean annual position of water table. \nd) Maps that show amplitudes of ground water level fluctuations and the maximum \nposition of the water table of considerab le importance for artificial recharge \nstudies. \ne) Maps showing piezometric head in deeper aquifers and their variations with time. \n \n  \n  \n \nf) Maps showing ground water potential of different hydrogeologi cal units and the \nlevel of ground water development. \ng) Maps showing chemical quality of ground water in different aquifers. \n \nThe usefulness of all the above interpre tative maps is additive, i.e. their \nconjunctive usage allow greater knowledge and understanding of an area than when a map \nis used separately. \n \nAt this level of hydrogeological mappi ng of the area few questions should be \nanswered, \n \n1. Whether there is any gap in data on sub-surface geology of the available \nlithological logs of the boreholes in the ar ea are sufficient to arrive at a correct \npicture of aquifer geometry of the area. \n \n2. Whether the available data on aquifer para meters is sufficient in case the area \nshows promise for artificial recharge techniques for deeper aquifers through \nInjection well",
    "ometry of the area. \n \n2. Whether the available data on aquifer para meters is sufficient in case the area \nshows promise for artificial recharge techniques for deeper aquifers through \nInjection well etc. \n \n3. Can the available ground water structur e serve the purpose of monitoring the \neffects of artificial recharge Project \n \nAquifer Geometry : The data on the sub-surface hydrogeological units, their \nthickness and depth of occurrence, and to  bring out the dis position and hydraulic \nproperties of unconfined , semi-confined and c onfined aquifers in the area.  For surface \nwater spreading techniques the area of interest  is generally restricted to shallow depths. \nThe main stress is on knowing whether the su rface rock types are sufficiently permeable \nor not to maintain high rate of infiltration during the artificial recharge.  \n \n \n2.2.5 Geophysical Studies  \n \na) The main purpose of applying geophysical methods for the selection of appropriate \nsite for artificial recharge studies is  mostly to help and assess the unknown sub-\nsurface hydrogeological conditions economi cally, adequately and unambiguously. \nGenerally the prime task is to compliment  the exploratory programme. Mostly it is \nemployed to narrow down the target zone, pinp oint the probable site for artificial \nrecharge structure and its proper design. \n \nb) Nevertheless, the application of geophysical methods is to bring out a comparative \npicture of the sub-surface litho environm ent, surface manifestation of such \nstructures, and correlate them with the hydrogeological setting. \n \nc) Besides defining the sub-surface structure and lithology, it can identify the \nbrackish/fresh ground water interface, cont aminated zone (saline) and the area \nprone to seawater intrusion. \n  \n  \n \nUsing certain common geophysical methods, it is possible to model the  \n \ni) Stratification of aquifer system and spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity \nof the characteristic zone, suitable for artificial rechar",
    "n geophysical methods, it is possible to model the  \n \ni) Stratification of aquifer system and spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity \nof the characteristic zone, suitable for artificial recharge. \n \nii) Negative or non-productive zones of lo w hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated \nand saturated zones. \n \niii) Vertical hydraulic conductivity discontinuities, such as dyke and fault zone. \n \niv) Moisture movement and infiltration capacity of the unsaturated zone. \n \nv) Direction of ground water flow under natural/artificial recharge processes. \n \nvi) Salinity ingress, trend and short duration depth salinity changes in the aquifers \ndue to varied abstraction or recharge. \n \nThe application of proper techniques, plan of survey and suitable instruments will \ndefinitely yield better understandable results, but, of indirect nature. \n \n \n2.2.6 Chemical Quality of Source Water \n            \nProblem which arise as a result of rechar ge to ground water are mainly related to \nthe quality of raw waters that are available for recharge and which are generally require \nsome sort of treatment before being used is r echarge installations. They are also related to \nthe changes in the soil structure and the bi ological phenomena which take place when \ninfiltration begins, to the changes brought to  the environmental conditions. The chemical \nand bacteriological analysis of source wate r besides that of gr ound water is therefore \nessential. \n \n \n2.2.7 Suspended matter may clog the soil in two different ways \n \nSuspended Solids and Clogging Problem: A major requirement for waters that are \nto be used in recharge projects is that they be silt-free. Silt may be defined as the content \nof undissolved solid matter, usually measured in mg/l, which settles in stagnant water with \nvelocities which do not exceed 0.1 m/hr. To obta in still clearer water, with only 10 - 12 \nmg/l suspended solids, further additions of flocculants and, frequently, agitation of the \nwater must be resorted to",
    "es which do not exceed 0.1 m/hr. To obta in still clearer water, with only 10 - 12 \nmg/l suspended solids, further additions of flocculants and, frequently, agitation of the \nwater must be resorted to. \n \n \nFirst, near the surface the interstices of the soil may be filled up and a layer of mud \nmay be deposited on the surface, on the other hand suspended particles may penetrate \ndeeper into the soil and accumulate there. \n \n  \n  \n \nMethods to minimize the clogging effect by suspended matter can be classified \ninto broad groups: \n \na) Periodical removing of the mud-cake and dicing or scraping of the surface layer. \n \nb) Installation of a filter on th e surface, the permeability of  which is lower than that \nof the natural strata (the filter mu st, of course, be removed and renewed \nperiodically) \n \nc) Addition of organic matter or chemicals to the uppermost layer. \n \nd) Cultivation of certain plant-covers, notably certain kinds of grass. \n \nProviding inverted filter consisting of fine sand coarse sand and gravel at the \nbottom of infiltration pits/trenches are very effective. \n \nClogging by biological activity depends upon the mineralogical and organic \ncomposition of the water and basin floor and upon the grain-size and permeability of the \nfloor. The only feasible method of treatment developed so far consists in thoroughly \ndrying the ground under the basin. \n \n \n2.3 Assessment Of Sub-Surface Potential For Ground Water  Recharge  \n \nBased on the hydrogeological and geophysical surveys, the thickness of potential \nunsaturated zone for recharge should be work ed out to assess the potential for artificial \nrecharge in terms of volume of water which can be accommodated in this zone vis-à-vis \nsource water availability. The studies should br ing out the potential of unsaturated zone in \nterms of total volume which can be recharged.       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n3.0      ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE TECHNIQUES AND DESIGNS \n \nA wide spectrum of techniques are in vogue to",
    "ated zone in \nterms of total volume which can be recharged.       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n3.0      ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE TECHNIQUES AND DESIGNS \n \nA wide spectrum of techniques are in vogue to recharge ground water reservoir. \nSimilar to the variations in hydrogeological fr amework, the artificial  recharge techniques \ntoo vary widely.  The artificial recharge techniques can be broadly categorised as follows:-  \n \na. Direct surface techniques \n• Flooding \n• Basins or percolation tanks \n• Stream augmentation \n• Ditch and furrow system \n• Over irrigation \n \nb. Direct sub surface techniques \n• Injection wells or recharge wells \n• Recharge pits and shafts \n• Dug well recharge \n• Bore hole flooding \n• Natural openings, cavity fillings. \n \nc. Combination surface – sub-surface techniques \n• Basin or percolation tanks with pit shaft or wells. \n \nd. Indirect Techniques \n• Induced recharge from surface water source. \n• Aquifer modification. \n \nBesides above, the ground water conser vation structures like ground water dams, \nsub-surface dykes or locally termed as Bandharas,  are quite prevalent to arrest sub-surface \nflows.  Similarly in hard rock areas rock fr acturing techniques including sectional blasting \nof boreholes with suitable techniques has been  applied to inter-connect the fractures and \nincrease recharge.  Cement sealing of fractures, through sp ecially constructed bore well \nhas been utilised in Maharashtra to cons erve sub-surface flow and augment bore well \nyield. (A schematic diagram of these is given in Fig. 1). \n \n \n3.1 Artificial Recharge Structures \n \n3.1.1 Ditch and Furrow Method:  \n \nIn areas with irregular topography, shallow, flat bottomed and closely spaced \nditches or furrows provide maximum water c ontact area for recharge water from source \nstream or canal.  This technique requires less soil preparation than the recharge basins and \nis less sensitive to silting.  Fig. 2 shows a typi cal plan or series of ditches originating from \na supply d",
    "eam or canal.  This technique requires less soil preparation than the recharge basins and \nis less sensitive to silting.  Fig. 2 shows a typi cal plan or series of ditches originating from \na supply ditch and trending dow n the topographic slope towa rds the stream.  Generally \nthree patterns of ditch and furrow system are adopted. \n  \n  \n \n \n3.1.1.1 Lateral Ditch Pattern \n \n The water from stream is diverted to the feeder canal/ditch from which smaller \nditches are made at right angles .  The rate of flow of water from the feeder canal to these \nditches is controlled by gate valves.  The furrow depth is kept according to the topography \nand also with the aim that maximum wetted surface is available along with maintenance of \nuniform velocity.  The excess water is routed  to the main stream through a return canal \nalong with residual silt. \n \n \n3.1.1.2 Dendritic Pattern \n \nThe water from stream can be diverted from  the main canal to a series of smaller \nditches spread in a dendritic pattern.  The bifu rcation of ditches continues until practically \nall the water is infiltrated in the ground. \n \n \n3.1.1.3   Contour Pattern \n \nThe ditches are excavated following the ground surface contour of the area.  When \nthe ditch comes closer to the stream a switch back is made and thus the ditch is made to \nmeander back and forth to traverse the spread  are repeatedly.  At the lowest point down \nstream, the ditch joins the main stream, thus returning the excess water to it. \n \n \n3.1.1.4  Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines \n \na. Although this method is adaptable to irre gular terrain, the water contact area \nseldom exceeds 10 percent of the total recharge area. \nb.    Ditches should have slope to mainta in flow velocity and minimum deposition \n  of  sediments.  \nc. Ditches should be shallow, flat-bottomed, and closely spaced to obtain.             \nMaximum water contact area.  Width of 0.3 to 1.8 m. are typical \nd.

A collecting ditch to convey the excess water back to the main stream channel \nshould be provided. \n \n     \n3.1.2  Percolation Tanks (PT) / Spreading Basin \n \nThese are the most prevalent structures in India as a measure to recharge the \nground water reservoir both in al luvial as well as hard rock  formations.  The efficacy and \nfeasibility of these structures is more in hard rock formation where the rocks are highly \nfractured and weathered.  In the States of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, \nKarnataka and Gujarat, the percolation tanks ha ve been constructed in plenty in basaltic \nlava flows and crystalline rocks. A typical design of PT is given in Fig. 3 The percolation \n  \n  \n \ntanks are however also feasible in mountain fronts occupied by talus scree deposits.  These \nare found to be very effective in Satpura Mountain front area in  Maharashtra.  The \npercolation tanks can also be constructed in the Bhabar zone. Percolation tanks with wells \nand shafts Percolation tanks are also constr ucted to recharge deeper aquifers where \nshallow or superficial formations are hi ghly impermeable or clayey with certain \nmodification.  Recharge wells with filter are constructed in the Percolation Tanks and the \nstored water is Moti Ranjan and Bhujpur, Mandvi Kutch district, Gujarat. \n \n3.1.2.1 Important Aspects of Percolation Tanks: \n \na. A detailed analysis of rainfall patter n, number of rainy days, dry spells, and \nevaporation rate and detailed hydrogeol ogical studies to demarcate suitable \npercolation tank sites. \n \nb. In Peninsular India with semi arid climat e, the storage capacity of percolation tank \nbe designed such that the water percol ates to ground water reservoir by January \nsince the evaporation losses would be high subsequently. \n \nc.

    "that the water percol ates to ground water reservoir by January \nsince the evaporation losses would be high subsequently. \n \nc. Percolation tanks be normally constructed on second to third order stream since the \ncatchment so also the submergence area would be smaller. \n \nd. The submergence area should be in uncultivable land as far as possible. \n \ne. Percolation tank be located on highly fr actured and weathered rock for speedy \nrecharge.  In case of alluvium, the bouldary formations are ideal for locating \nPercolation Tanks. \n \nf. The aquifer to be recharge should have sufficient thickness of permeable vadose \nzone to accommodate recharge. \n \ng. The benefitted area should have sufficient number of wells and cultivable land to \ndevelop the recharge water. \n \nh. Detailed hydrological studies  for run off assessment be done and design capacity \nshould not normally be more than 50% of total quantum of rainfall in catchment. \n \ni. Waste weir or spillway be suitably designed to allow flow of surplus water based \non single day maximum rainfall after the rank is filled to its maximum capacity. \n \nj. Cut off trench be provided to minimise seepage losses both below and above nalla \nbed. \n \nk. To avoid erosion of embankment due to ripple action stone pitching be provided \nupstream upto HFL. \n \nl. Monitoring mechanism in benefitted as well as catchment area using observation  \n  \n  \n \n well and staff gauges be provided to assess the impact and benefits of percolation  tank. \n \n \n3.1.3 Check Dams Cement Plug  nala bunds \n \n Check dams are constructed across sm all streams having gentle slope and are \nfeasible both in hard rock as well as alluvi al formation.  The site selected for check dam \nshould have sufficient thickness of permeable bed or weathered form ation to facilitate \nrecharge of stored water within short span of time.  The water stored in these structures is \nmostly confined to stream course and the height is normally less than 2 m.  These are \ndesigned based on s",
    "recharge of stored water within short span of time.  The water stored in these structures is \nmostly confined to stream course and the height is normally less than 2 m.  These are \ndesigned based on stream width and excess wate r is allowed to flow over the wall.  In \norder to avoid scouring from excess run o ff, water cushions are provided at down \nstreamside.  To harness the maximum run off in  the stream, series of such check dams can \nbe constructed to have recharge on regional scale. \n \n A series of small bunds or weirs are made across selected nala sections such that \nthe flow of surface water in the stream channel is impede d and water is retained on \npervious soil/tock surface for longer body. Na la bunds are constructed across bigger nalas \nof second order streams in areas having gent ler slopes.  A nala bund acts like a mini \npercolation tank. The design aspects of check dam/Cement plug are given in Fig. 4. \n \nSite Characteristic and Design Guidelines :  For selecting a site for Check Dams/Nala \nbunds the following conditions may be observed. \n \n1. The total catchment of the nala sh ould normally be between 40 to 100 \nHectares. though the local situations can be guiding factor in this. \n \n2. The rainfall in the catchment should be less than 1000 mm/annum. \n \n3. The width of nala bed should be atleast 5 metres and not exceed 15 metres \nand the depth of bed should not be less than 1 metre. \n \n4. The soil down stream of the bund shoul d not be prone to water logging and \nshould have pH between 6.5 to 8. \n \n5. The lands downstream of Check Da m/bund should have irrigable land \nunder well irrigation. \n \n6. The Nala bunds should be preferable located in area where contour or \ngraded bunding or lands have been carried out. \n \n7. The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately permeable \nto cause ground water recharge through ponded water. \n \n8. Nala bund is generally a small earthen dam, with a cut off core wall of \nbrick work, though cement bunds",
    "area should be adequately permeable \nto cause ground water recharge through ponded water. \n \n8. Nala bund is generally a small earthen dam, with a cut off core wall of \nbrick work, though cement bunds/plugs are now  prevalent. \n  \n  \n \n \n9. For the foundation for core wall a trench is dug 0.6 m wide in hard rock or \n1.2 metres in soft rock of impervious nature.  A core brick cement wall is \nerected 0.6 m wide to stand atleast 2.5 metres above nala bed and the \nremaining portion of trench is back filled on upstream side by impervious \nclay.  The core wall is buttressed on  both sides by a bund made up of local \nclays and on the upstream face, stone pitching is done. \n \n10. Normally the final dimensions of the Nala bund are; length 10 to 15 metres, \nheight 2 to 3 metres and width 1 to 3 metres, generally constructed in a \ntrapezoidal form.  If the bedrock is  highly fractured, cement grouting is \ndone to make the foundation leakage free. \n \n The check dams are also popular and feas ible in Bhabar, Kandi and talus scree \nareas of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Mahara shtra and have substantial impact on \naugmentation of ground water.  \n \n \n3.1.4. Gabion Structure \n \nThis is a kind of check dam being comm only constructed across small stream to \nconserve stream flows with  practically no submergence beyond stream course.  The \nboulders locally available are stored in a stee l wire.  This is put up across the stream's \nmesh to make it as a small dam by anchoring it to the streamside (fig 5).  The height of \nsuch structures is around 0.5 m and is normally used in the streams with width of about 10 \nto 15 m.  The cost of such structures is around Rs.10 to 15000/-.  The excess water \noverflows this structure storing some water to serve as source of recharge.  The silt \ncontent of stream water in due  course is deposited in the interstices of the boulders to \nmake it more impermeable. These structures are common in the State of Maharashtra, \nMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh etc.",
    "tream water in due  course is deposited in the interstices of the boulders to \nmake it more impermeable. These structures are common in the State of Maharashtra, \nMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh etc. \n \n \n3.1.5. Modification of Village tanks as recharge structure \n \n The existing village tanks which are normally silted and damaged can be modified \nto serve as recharge structure.  In genera l no “Cut Off Trench” (COT) and Waste Weir is \nprovided for village tanks.  Desilting, coupl ed with providing proper waste weir and \nC.O.T. on the upstream side, the village tanks can be converte d into recharge structure. \nSeveral such tanks are available which can  be modified for enhancing ground water \nrecharge. Some of the tanks in Maharashtra and Karnataka have been converted. \n \n \n3.1.6. Inter Watershed Transfer \n \n The percolation tanks in a watershed may not have enough catchment discharge \nthough a high capacity tank is possi ble as per site c onditions.  In such situations stream \n  \n  \n \nfrom nearby watershed can be diverted with  some additional cost and the tank can be \nmade more efficient.  Such an effort was made in Satpura Mountain front area at Nagadevi \nJalgaon district, Maharashtra.   The existing capacity of the tank of 350 TMC was never \nutilised after its cons truction. This could however be fi lled by stream diversion from \nadjacent watershed. \n \n3.1.7 Dug Well Recharge \n \n In alluvial as well as hard rock areas, there are thousands of dug wells which have \neither gone dry or the water levels have d eclined considerably.  These dug wells can be \nused as structures to rechar ge (Fig 6 & 7). The ground water reservoir, storm water, tank \nwater, canal water etc. can be diverted into th ese structures to direc tly recharge the dried \naquifer.  By doing so the soil moisture lo sses during the normal process of artificial \nrecharge, are reduced.  The recharge water is guided through a pipe to the bottom of well, \nbelow the water level to avoid scoring of bottom a",
    "moisture lo sses during the normal process of artificial \nrecharge, are reduced.  The recharge water is guided through a pipe to the bottom of well, \nbelow the water level to avoid scoring of bottom and entrapment of air bubbles in the \naquifer.  The quality of sour ce water including the silt cont ent should be such that the \nquality of ground water reservoir is not dete riorated. Schematic diagrams of dug well \nrecharge are given in figures 6 &7. \n \n \n3.1.8 Recharge Shaft \n These are the most efficient and cost eff ective structures to recharge the aquifer \ndirectly. In the areas where source of water is available either for some time or perennially \ne.g. base flow, springs etc. the recharge shaf t can be constructed (Fig 8).  Following are \nsite characteristics and design guidelines: - \n \n(i) To be dug manually of the strata is non-caving nature. \n(ii) If the strata is caving, proper permeable lining in the form of open work, boulder \nlining are should be provided. \n(iii) The diameter of shaft should normally be more than 2 m to accommodate more \nwater and to avoid eddies in the well. \n(iv) In the areas where source water is having silt, the shaft should be filled with \nboulder, good and sand from bottom to have inverted filler.  The upper most sandy \nlayer has to be removed and cleaned periodically. A filter be provided before the \nsource water enters the shaft. \n(v) When water is put into the recharge shaft directly th rough pipes, air bubbles are \nalso sucked into the shaft through the pipe which can choke the aquifer. The \ninjection pipe should therefore  be lowered below the water level, to avoid this \n \nThe main advantages of this technique are as follows: - \n \n* It does not require acquisition of larg e piece of land like percolation tanks. \n \n* There  are  practically  no  losses  of  water  in   the   form   of   soil   moisture  and \nevaporation, which normally occur when the source water has to traverse the  \nvadose zone  \n  \n  \n \n \n* Disused or even o",
    "actically  no  losses  of  water  in   the   form   of   soil   moisture  and \nevaporation, which normally occur when the source water has to traverse the  \nvadose zone  \n  \n  \n \n \n* Disused or even operational dugwells can be  converted into recharge shafts, which  \ndoes not involve additional investment for recharge structure.  \n \n* Technology  and  design  of  the  recharge  shaft  is simple and can be applied even \n where baseflow is available for a limited period. \n \n* The  recharge  is  fast  and  immediately  delivers  the  benefit. In highly permeable \nformation, the recharge shaft are comp arable to percolation tanks with no \nsubmergence and hence no land compensation to local farmers. \n \n The recharge shafts can be constructed in  two different ways viz. Vertical and \nlateral. The details of each is given in the following paragraphs. \n \n \n3.1.8.1 Vertical Recharge Shaft - The vertical recharge shaft can be further improvised \nwith injection well at the bottom of the shaft. \n \n(a) Without Injection well   \n \n• Ideally suited for deep water levels (up to 15 metres b.g.l.) \n• Presence of clay is encountered within 15 m.  \n• Effective in the areas of less vertical natural recharge  \n• Copious water available can be effectively recharged. \n• Effective with silt water also (using inverted filter consisting of layers \nof sand, gravel and boulder) \n• Depth and diameter depends upon the depth of aquifer and volume of \nwater to be recharged. \n• The rate of recharge depends on the a quifer material and silt content in \nthe water.  \n• The rate of recharge  with inverted filter ranges from 7 - 14 lps for 2 - 3 \nmeter diameter.  \n \n \nThis type of shaft has been constructed at the following places. \n \n• Brahm Sarovar, Kurukshetra district, Haryana - Silt free water \n• Dhuri drain, Sangrur district, Punjab - surface run off with heavy silt \n• Dhuri link drain, Sangrur district, Punjab - surface run off with heavy \nsilt \n• President Estate, New Delhi - Roof Top and Surface",

(Fig.-9) \n \n• Ideally suitable for very deep water levels (more than 15 meters) \n• Aquifer is over lain by impervious thick clay beds  \n• Injection well can be with or without assembly \n• The injection well with assembly s hould have screen in the potential \naquifer at least 3 – 5 meter below the water level. \n• The injection well without assembly is  filled with gravel to provide \nhydraulic continuity so that water is directly recharged into the aquifer  \n• The injection well without assembly is very cost effective. \n• Depending upon volume of water to be injected, number of injection \nwells, can be increased to enhance the recharge rate. \n• The efficiency is very high and rate  of recharge goes even up to 15 lps \nat certain places.  \n \nThese structures have been constructed at following places. \n \n♦ Injection Well Without Assembly  \n• Dhuri drain, Sangrur district, Punjab  \n• Issru, Khanna block, Ludhiana district, Punjab \n• Lodi Garden, New Delhi \n• Dhaneta, Samana Block, Patiala district, Punjab \n \n♦ Injection Well With Assembly \n• Dhuri drain, Sangrur district, Punjab  \n• Dhuri Link drain, Sangrur district, Punjab  \n• Kalasinghian, Jalandhar district, Punjab \n \n \n3.1.8.2  Lateral Recharge Shaft  \n \n• Ideally suited for areas where permeable sandy horizon is within 3 \nmeter below ground level and conti nues upto the water level - under \nunconfined con",

Artificial Recharge Through Injection Wells \n \n    Injection wells are structures similar to a tube well but with the purpose of \naugmenting the groundwater storage of a confin ed aquifer by pumping in treated surface \nwater under pressure (Figure 10). The injection wells are advantageous when land is scarce.  \n \n              This techniques was successf ully adopted at temple town of Bhadrachallam in \nA.P. during 1987 to provide safe drinking water to about 2 to 3 lakh pilgrims on the festival \nof Shriramanawami.  The ground water aqui fer had meager reserve and had to be \nnecessarily replenished through induced recharge  from Godavari River.

    "e \nnecessarily replenished through induced recharge  from Godavari River.  The surface water \ncould not be directly pumped to the distributi on system due to turbidity and bacteriological \ncontaminations.  A water supply scheme was successfully executed by construction of 30 \nfilter point wells of 90 cm dia which yielded about 60 cubic metre/ha of potable water, \nmainly the induced recharge from river with phreatic alluvial aqui fer acting as filtering \nmedium. Hydraulically the effectiveness of  induction of water in injection well is \ndetermined by: - \n \n(a) Pumping Rate \n(b) Permeability of aquifer \n(c) Distance from stream \n(d) Natural ground water gradient \n(e) Type of well \n \n            In alluvial areas injection well recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can \nbe constructed to normal gravel packed pum ping well. An injection pipe with opening \nagainst the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient.  However, in case of number of \npermeable zones separated by impervious rock s, a properly designed injection well with \ninlet pipe against each aquifer to be recharge d need to be constructed. The injection wells \n  \n  \n \nas a means of artificial recharge are comp aratively costlier and require specialised \ntechniques of tubewell constructed supported by operation and maintenance to protect the \nrecharge well from clogging. \n \n \n3.1.10 Induced Recharge: \n \n            It is an indirect method of artificial  recharge involving pumping from aquifer \nhydraulically connected with surface water, to induce recharge to the ground water \nreservoir.  When the cone of depression intercepts river recharge boundary a hydraulic \nconnection gets established with surface source which starts providing part of the pumpage \nyield.  In such methods there is actually no artificial build  up of ground water storage but \nonly passage of surface water to the pump through an aquifer.   In this sense, it is more a \npumpage augmentation rather than artificial recharge measure.",
    "icial build  up of ground water storage but \nonly passage of surface water to the pump through an aquifer.   In this sense, it is more a \npumpage augmentation rather than artificial recharge measure.  (Fig. 11). \n \n           In hardrock areas the aband oned channels often provide good sites for induced \nrecharge.  Check weir in stream channel, at  location up stream of the channel bifurcation, \ncan help in high infiltration from surface reservoir to the abandoned channel when heavy \npumping is carried out in wells located in the burried channel. \n \n           The greatest advantage of th is method is that under  favourable hydrogeological \nsituations the quality of su rface water generally improves due to its path through the \naquifer material before it is discharged from the pumping well.   \n  \n            For obtaining very large water supplies from river bed la ke bed deposits or water-\nlogged areas, collector wells are constructed.  In India such wells have been installed in \nYamuna Bed at Delhi and other places in Gu jarat, Tamil Nadu and Orissa.  The large \ndischarges and lower lift heads make these wells  economical even if initial capital cost is \nhigher as compared to tube well. \n \n           In areas where the phreatic aqui fer adjacent to the river is of limited thickness, \nhorizontal wells may be more appropriate th an vertical wells.  Collector well with \nhorizontal laterals and infiltra tion galleries can get more induced recharge from the stream \ncollector wells constructed in seasonal nala beds these can be effective as induced recharge \nstructures for short periods only. \n          \nSite Characteristics and Design Guidelines:     1. A collector well is a large diameter (4 \nto 8 m) well from which laterals are driven/d rilled near the bottom at one or two levels \ninto permeable strata.  The central well is a vertical concrete cassion in precast rings, (wall \nthickness 0.45 m) sunk upto the bottom of aqui fer horizon.  The bo ttom of cassion is \nseal",
    "wo levels \ninto permeable strata.  The central well is a vertical concrete cassion in precast rings, (wall \nthickness 0.45 m) sunk upto the bottom of aqui fer horizon.  The bo ttom of cassion is \nsealed by thick concrete plugs.  Slotted stee l pipes, 9 mm thick, 15 to 50 cm in diameter \nhaving open area above 15% and a tapered leading are driven  laterally through port holes \nat appropriate places in the cassion.  The successive slotted pipes are welded and driven \nusing special hydraulic jacks installed at the bottom of the cassion.  The number of laterals \nis usually less than 16 thus permitting minimu m angle of 22 30”, between two laterals.  \nThe maximum length of lateral reported is 132 m. and the total length of laterals from 120 \n  \n  \n \nto 900 m. depending upon requirement of yield. \n \n2. The laterals are developed by flushing and if  entrance velocity of water is kept less \nthan 6-9 mm/sec, these do not get filled by sand.  The effective radius of a collector well is \n75 to 85% of the individual lateral length. \n \n \n3.1.11 Ground Water Dams Or Sub-Surface Dykes Or Underground Bandharas  \n(UGB): \n \n            These are basically ground wa ter conservation structures and are effective to \nprovide sustainability to ground w ater stru ctures by arresting sub surface flow. A ground \nwater dam is a sub-surface ba rrier across stream which re tards the natural ground water \nflow of the system and stores water belo w ground surface to meet the demands during the \nperiod of need (Fig.12).  The main purpose of  ground water dam is to arrest the flow of \nground water out of the sub-basin and increase th e storage within the aquifer.  By dowing \nso the water levels in upstream part of ground water dam rises saturating the otherwise dry \npart of aquifer.   \n \n            The underground dam has following advantages: - \n \n*          Since the water is stored within the aquifer, submergence of land can be avoided  \nand land above reservoir can be utilised even after the",
    "he underground dam has following advantages: - \n \n*          Since the water is stored within the aquifer, submergence of land can be avoided  \nand land above reservoir can be utilised even after the construction of the dam. \n \n* No evaporation loss from the reservoir takes place. \n \n* No siltation in the reservoir takes place. \n \n* The potential disaster like collapse of dams can be avoided \n      \n            The aquifer to be replenished is generally one which is already over exploited by \ntube well pumpage and the declining trend of water levels in the aquifer has set in.  \nBecause of the confining layers of low pe rmeability the aquifer can not get natural \nreplenishment from the surface and needs di rect injection through recharge wells.  \nArtificial recharge of aquifers by injection well is also done in coastal regions to arrest the \ningress of sea water and to combat the problems of land subsidence in areas where \nconfined aquifers are heavily pumped. \n \n          In alluvial areas injection well recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can \nbe constructed in a fashion similar to nor mal gravel packed pumping well.  The only \ndifference is that cement sealing of the uppe r section of the well is done in order to \nprevent the injection pressures from forcing leakage of water through the annular space of \nbore hole and well assembly.  In  hard rock areas casing a nd well screens may not be \nrequired.  An injection pipe with opening against the aquife r to be recharged may be \nsufficient.  However, in case of number of permeable horizons separated by impervious \nrocks like vesicular basalts or cavernous limes tones, a properly designed injection well \nmay be constructed with slotte d pipe against the aquifer to be recharged.  In practice the \n  \n  \n \ninjection rates are limited by the physical characteri stics of the aquifer.  In the vicinity of \nwell, the speed of groundwater flow may increa se to the point that the aquifer is eroded, \nspecially if it",
    "ion rates are limited by the physical characteri stics of the aquifer.  In the vicinity of \nwell, the speed of groundwater flow may increa se to the point that the aquifer is eroded, \nspecially if it is made up of unconsolidated or semi-consolidated rocks.  In confined \naquifer confining layers may fail if too great pressure is created under them.  If this \noccurs, the aquifer will become clogged in the vicinity of the borehole and/or may \ncollapse. \n \n \n3.1.12 Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting  \n \nIn Urban areas, the roof top rainwater can be conserved and used for recharge of \nground water. This approach requires connecting the outlet pipe from rooftop to divert the \nwater to either existing wells/ tubewells/borewell or specially designed wells. The urban \nhousing complexes or institutional buildings have large roof area and can be utilising for \nharvesting roof top rainwater to recharge a quifer in urban areas (Fig 12A).

The monitoring data speaks for the \nefficacy of structures constructed for artific ial recharge and greatly helps in taking \neffective measures for Ground Water Management on scientific lines. \n \n \n4.1 Water Level Monitoring \n \n               During the feasibility study stage the monitoring of surface water and ground \nwater levels greatly help in identifying the method of artificial rech arge.  Net work of \nobservation wells is used to study the ground wa ter flow pattern and temporal changes in \npotentiometric head in the aquifer. \n \n              The observation well net work  during feasibility stage is generally of low well \ndensity but spread over a large area with  the primary aim of defining the boundary \nzonation of the aquifer to be recharged and to know the hydraulic characteristics of the \nnatural ground water system.  After identification of the feasible groundwater structure the \nobservation well net work is redefined in a sm aller area with greater well density.  The \nobjective of monitoring system is to study the e ffect of artificial recharge on the natural \nground water system.  Depending on the me thod of artificial recharge and the \nhydrogeology of the area, the observation well net work has to  be designed.

    "ial recharge and the \nhydrogeology of the area, the observation well net work has to  be designed.  The \nmonitoring system of observa tion well network should be desi gned specially to monitor \nimpact of individual structures which can furt her be extended to monitor the impact of \ngroup of such structures in the artificial recharge scheme area.  The net work should \ncontain observation wells (1) near the center of the recharge facility (2) a sufficient \ndistance from the recharge facility to observe  composite effects and (3) near the limit of \nhydrological boundaries.  If the recharged aqui fer is overlain by confining/semi-confining \nlayer, piezometers should be installed to monitor the wate r levels of overlying and \nunderlying aquifers which helps in the study of leakages etc. \n \n               Where the surface water bodies are hydraulically connected with the ground \nwater aquifer which is being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles \nof both Surface water and Ground water.  \n \n               The periodic monitoring of Water Levels can demarcate the zone of benefit.  In \nthis method a network of observation wells is established in the area likely to be benefitted \nand following observations are made: - \n \n1. In the zone benefitted, the water leve ls be observed to the whether the well \nhydrographs have a flat apex during the time when  there is water in the recharge structure \n(tank, pit etc.). \n \n2.          Wells situated outside the zone of influence nor mally show an angular apex for \n  \n  \n \nthe period when the recharge is  taking place, while these situated within the zone of \ninfluence have a flatter area. \n \n3. The recession limbs of wells close to a recharge structure normally have a gentle \ngradient as compared to those located far off. \n \n4. Crops in the zone of influence will be healthy compared to those outside such an \narea.  Further more, in the zone of influen ce there is a tendency to  grow crops with high \nwater requi",
    "ar off. \n \n4. Crops in the zone of influence will be healthy compared to those outside such an \narea.  Further more, in the zone of influen ce there is a tendency to  grow crops with high \nwater requirements. \n \n5. Well yields in the zone of influence shoul d be greater than those outside it.  The \nwells in benefitted zones may have more sustainability in lean period than those outside. \n \n                The above criteria can be used to define the zone of influence and thereby, a real \nand temporal demarcation of the effectivene ss of recharge structures.  This methodology \nwas adopted in Maharashtra, India (Fig.13). \n \n \n4.2 Tracer Technique For Demarcating Zone Of Benefit \n \n            The tracers are useful in demarcating the area benefitted by artificial recharge, \nTritium; Rodhomine B, fluorescent dye and environmental isotopes etc. are quite useful in \nassessing the extent of recharge and efficiency of recharge structures. \n \n \n4.3 Water Quality Monitoring \n \n               The monitoring of water quality during the implementation of artificial recharge \nschemes is essential to maintain the quality standards for specified uses of the augmented \nresource.  In case of injection wells the com position of native water in the aquifer and the \nrecharged water is important to prevent cl ogging of well and aquife r due to excessive \nprecipitation of salts.  The data on the chemi cal quality of native water and the changes \nwhich take place during the artificial rechar ge schemes should be collected by regular \nsampling from observation well net work.  Where treated wastewater is used for recharge \na careful monitoring is required to detect a nd preclude any possibility of contamination \nthrough a network of monitoring wells.  Thus , the type of water quality monitoring \nprogramme depends on the spec ific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water \nquality, effect of soil salina tion, and prevention of any contam ination etc.  The samples to \nbe collected wi",
    "programme depends on the spec ific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water \nquality, effect of soil salina tion, and prevention of any contam ination etc.  The samples to \nbe collected will also depend on the purpose and are generally categorised into (1) \nIndicative (2) Basic and (3) Comprehensive.  The indicative samples are collected at 1 to 4 \nmonths intervals and used to ascertain the presence of injected effluent.  Basic samples are \ntaken at monthly intervals for wells already influenced by recharge to determine the effect \nof recharge effluent on ground water quality and the purification provided by flow through \nthe soil and aquifer system.  Comprehensive samp les are taken at interv als of 6 months to \n1 year for observation wells and production wells  to determine water quality with respect \nto specific standards for intended water use.  \n  \n  \n \n4.4  IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \n The impact assessment of Artificial Recharge schemes can generally be \nenumerated as follows: - \n \na) Conservation and harvesting of surplus monsoon runoff in ground water reservoir \nwhich otherwise was going un-utilised outside the watershed/ basin and to sea. \nb) Rise in ground water levels due to add itional recharge to ground water.  In case \nwhere continuous decline of ground water le vel was taking place , a check to this \nand/or the intensity of decline subseque ntly reduces. The energy consumption for \nlifting the water also reduces. \nc) The ground water structures in the benefitt ed zone of artificia l structures gains \nsustainability and the wells provides wate r in lean month when these were going \ndry.  The domestic wells will become su stainable and many of the areas become \ntanker free. \nd) The cropping pattern in the benefitted z one will undergo marked change due to \nadditionality of ground water and cash cr ops will start growing.

Orchards which \nwent dry earlier due to ground water scarcity may rehabilitated and new plantation \nbe grown. \ne) Green vegetation cover may increase in th e zone of benefit and also along the \nstructures due to additional availability of soil moisture. \nf) The quality of ground water may improve due to dilution. \ng) Besides the direct measurable impacts, the artificial recharge schemes will \ngenerate indirect benefit in terms of d ecease in soil erosion, improvement in fauna \nand flora, influx of migratory birds, etc.  Besides, the social and economic status of \nfarmers of benefitted zone will also substantially improve due to increase in crop \nproduction. \n \n \nRemarks: - \n \nFormat for preparation of Artif icial Recharge Project and Ch ecklist for planning is given \nin Annexure I and Annexure II\n. General guidelines for the evaluation of ground water \nrecharge projects with special reference to Basaltic Terrain is given in Annexure III. \n \n5.0 CASE HISTORIES OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE IN INDIA \n \n The artificial Recharge for augmentation of ground water reser voir and to provide \nsustainability to ground water development.

The multidisciplinary approach a dopted by Central Ground Water Board to \naugment sub-surface storage included topogr aphical studies to assess and understand \nvarious physiographic parameters important to locate the appropriate recharge structures, \nHydrometeorological studies to assess the rainfall pattern for working out design of \nrecharge structures, hydrological studies to assess non committed surplus monsoon run off \navailable for recharge and hydr ogeological studies to assess the capability of basaltic \naquifers to accommodate the additional recharge for utilisation in lean period.  The studies \nhave brought out that the watershed cove ring 488 sq.km. area has surplus monsoon runoff \nof about 98.9 Million Cubic Metres (MCM ) which can be conserved through simple \nartificial recharge structures  like percolation tanks and check dams (cement plugs).  The \nefficiency of these structures constructed at suitable locations with  appropriate design in \ncase of percolation tanks is 91% and for cement plugs 94%. \n \n \n The total capacity utilisation of percolat ion tank has been found to be upto 150% \ndue to repetitive fittings and up to 400% in case of cement plugs.   The benefitted area in \ncase of percolation tanks with gross storag e capacity varying from 71 to 220 Thousand \nCubic Metres (TCM) varied from 60 to 120 hectares (ha) during 1997-98 and benefits \nextended upto 1.5 km. down stream of percola tion tanks.  In case of cement plugs with \nstorage capacity varying from 2.10 TCM to 7.42 TCM varied from 3 to 15 ha during \n1997-98.

The  Figures 14 \nand 15 indicate the improvement in ground water levels in the command areas of \npercolation tank and Check dam. Additional areas were brought und er cultivation and \nareas of orange orchards have increased.  The project implemented by CGWB has proved \nthe techno-economic feasibility of the artificial recharge techniques in basaltic terrain with \nno adverse environmental impact. \n \n \n5.1.1 Technical Evaluation Studies in Jeur Sub-basin Ahmednagar District,      \n         Maharashtra: \n \nCentral Ground Water Board in collaboration with Directorate of Irrigation \nResearch and Development, Government of Maharashtra has studied the efficiency of \nexisting percolation tanks in sustaining the yield of dug wells used  for agriculture. The \nevaluation of 12 existing percolation tanks in Jeur Sub-basin, Ahmednagar district, during \n1989 brought the following. \n \n• The recharge to ground water or effectivene ss of percolation tanks varies from 36 to \n76.7% with an average of 49.6%. The locatio n of PT in suitabl e sites and proper \ndesign plays an important role in effectiveness and efficiency of percolation tanks. \n  \n  \n \n• In some of the percolation tanks, visible s eepage varies from 20 to 53% of the volume \nharvested.  This is mainly due to faulty designs. \n \n• The percolation tanks located over vesi cular and fractured basalts have better \nefficiency. \n \n• The evaporation losses are generally within 15% of the total storage. \n \n \n5.2     Mountain Front Recharge Augmen tation For Alluvial  Aquifers - \nMaharashtra: \n \nThe prominent regional aquifer system for Tapi Alluvial basin paralleling Satpura \nMountain front is being extens ively developed to meet th e water requirement of cash \ncrops like Banana and Sugarcane.

    "quifer system for Tapi Alluvial basin paralleling Satpura \nMountain front is being extens ively developed to meet th e water requirement of cash \ncrops like Banana and Sugarcane.  This has le d to decline of water levels of more than 8-\n10 metres during last 10-15 years.  Large num ber of wells has either gone dry or their \nyields have declined.  There is thus an urge nt need to augment the ground water resources \nof the Tapi alluvial basin.  The Satpura Mountain front offers favourable locale to \naugment ground water reservoir due to the hi gh infiltration capacity of alluvial fans \noccurring in this zone.  The Central Ground  Water Board has undertaken artificial \nrecharge studies in one of the watersheds TE-17 in Jalgaon distri ct wherein extensive \nground water irrigation for Banana crop ha s resulted in depletion of ground water \nresource.  The studies unde rtaken included assessmen t of surplus monsoon runoff \navailable in the watershed and delineation of potential talus and scree zone locally known \nas Bazada which offers favourable location for construction of artificial recharge \nstructures.  The studies included assessment of  the total thickness of unsaturated granular \nzone above water table to determine the potential of recharge in this zone.  The sub \nsurface storage potential of watershed 5 metr es below ground level was assessed as 85 \nMillion Cubic Metres (MCM ) compared to surplus monsoon runoff of 29.7 MCM.  \nArtificial recharge techniques like recharge through percola tion tanks, recharge through \nexisting dug wells, recharge sh afts and through injection tu bewells were experimented.  \nSome of the existing artificial recharge struct ures like village tanks were renovated to \nconvert these into percolation tanks and storage capacity of existing percolation tanks was \naugmented by stream diversion from adjacent watershed.

The percolation tanks in Bazada \nformation of Satpura foothills we re found to be highly efficient with efficiency as high as \n97% and capacity utilisation going upto 400%.  The zone of benefit extended to 5 km with \nbenefited area up to 400 ha.  The recharge through existing disused dug wells utilising \nsurplus water from existing canal irrigation sy stem provided encouraging results and after \nobserving this experiment, the local farmers have resorted to dug well recharge through \ntheir own efforts providing sustainability to ground water development.  Recharge through \ninjection tubewell though feasible is not very  effective and efficien t compared to other \nartificial recharge techniques.  The studi es undertaken by Central Ground Water Board \nhave clearly indicated that the Satpur a Mountain front is quite favourable for \nimplementation of a mega artificial recharge  project which can ut ilize the techniques \nexperimented in watershed TE-17 for augmen ting the depleting ground water resources of \nTapi Alluvial Tract (Fig. 16). \n  \n  \n \nCOST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ART IFICIAL RECHARGE STRUCTURES \nCONSTRUCTED UNDER THE PROJECT IN WATERSHED WR-2, DISTRICT \nAMRAVATI \n \n \nSl. \nNo. \nType of \nStructure \nAdditional \nRecharge \nto ground \nwater due \nto \nstructure \n(TCM) \nAddi-\ntional  \narea \nbrou-\nght \nunder \nirrigat-\nion (ha) \nIncre-\nmental \nincome \ndue  \n  to \nassured \nirrigat-\nion \n(Rs/ha/ \nyr) \nTotal \nincremen\n-tal    \nincome  \ndue  \naddition-\nal \nirrigation \nby \nstructure \n(Rs/yr) \nConstru-\nctional \ncost \nground \nwater of \nstructure \n(Rs.) \nLife \nof \nstruc\nture \n(yrs) \nAnnual \ninvest-\nment for \nconstr-\nction \n(Rs.) \nIncre-\nmental \non \nannual \nExpe-\nnditure \n@ \n10% \n(Rs.) \nTotal \nannual \ninves-\ntment \n(Rs.) \nCost \nbenefit \nratio \n(A)      PERCOLATION TANK \n1 Benoda    131.6  26.32 10,000 2,63,200 29,216,00   25 1,16,864 11,686 1,28,5\n50 \n1:2.00 \n2 Manikpu\nr \n   117.8  23.56 10,000 2,35,600 30,63,",

The \nexperiment involved transferri ng of water from shallow aquifer to the deeper confined \naquifer using siphon principle.  In this expe riment, a shallow tube well (dia : 350 mm) of \n21.34 m depth was drilled in west bank of Sa barmati river bed and tapping the shallow \nphreatic aquifer between 6.04 and 21.34 m below river bed level.  An injection well \n(diameter of 600 mm up to 75 m from ground level and followed by 400 mm to the depth \nof 240 m) to a depth of 238 m was drilled a nd developed at a distance of 61.3 m from the \nsource well on the same bank of the river.  An  observation well to the same depth of 238 \nm was drilled near the inj ection well to monitor the re sponse of the aquifer during \nartificial recharge.  These deep wells tap the confined aquifers below 74 m depth which \nare under heavy exploitation for agricultural activities.

The source of water drawn for the artifici al recharge through pressure injection test \nwas from the phreatic aquifer below the Sarswa ti river bed.  Since ground water was used \nfor artificial recharge, the injection water was devoid of silts and other impurities and \nchemically compatible with the water in a quifer getting recharged.  The experimental \nresults did not show any advers e effect of clogging.  The pr essure injection experiment \nwas conducted continuously for about 250 days with an average inje ction quantity of 225 \ncubic meters per day.  During the recharge cycle,  a rise in water level of 5 meters in the \ninjection well (apparent built up of 11 m) and 0.6 to 1.0 m in  wells 150 meters away from \nthe injection well were observed.  The higher rate of injection continuously for about 250 \ndays was probably su",
    "ction well (apparent built up of 11 m) and 0.6 to 1.0 m in  wells 150 meters away from \nthe injection well were observed.  The higher rate of injection continuously for about 250 \ndays was probably sustained because of cont emporaneous withdrawal from the aquifer \nthrough nearby irrigation wells. (Fig. 18). \n \n          In Mehsana area, artificial recharge experiments through spreading method were \nalso conducted using canal water.  A spread ing channel of 3.3 meters width, 400 m length \nwith 1 in 1 side slope was c onstructed and in which the cana l water was fed for 46 days.  \nThe recorded build up in water level of 1.4 to 2 m. was observed up to 15 m from the \nrecharge channel and about 20 cm at distance of 200 m.  The recharge rate of 260 cubic \nmeters per day was estimated using an infi ltration rate of 17 cm /day.  Dissipation in \nrecharge mound (1.42 m) was observed in 15 days. \n \n           Another experiment using a r echarge pit (1.7 m x 1.7 m x 0.75 m) to study the \nfeasibility of recharging the shallow aquifers was conduc ted at Dabhu in Central Mehsana \narea.  Canal water was used for the experime nt and the pit was covered to prevent dust \ndeposition and evaporation losses.  During th e recharge phase of 60 days, the recharge \nwas effected at the rate of 17.3 cubic meters per day with an  infiltration of 0.5 m/day.  A \nrise of 4.13 m in water level was observed at a distance of 5 meters from  the recharge pit.  \nBoth these recharge methods were effective in alluvial areas. \n \n           Artificial recharge through pre ssure injection technique was tried on a pilot scale \nusing ground water from phreatic aquifer fo r a short period in the Mehsana alluvial \naquifers.  The source well was located in the Saraswati River and the water was carried to \ninjection well at distance of 130 meters by 10 cm pipeline.  On-line flow meter and \npressure gauge were fitted to monitor the flow rate and cumulative quantity and to record \nthe pressure developed during inje",
    "well at distance of 130 meters by 10 cm pipeline.  On-line flow meter and \npressure gauge were fitted to monitor the flow rate and cumulative quantity and to record \nthe pressure developed during injection experiment.  The in jection recharge experiment \nwas conducted with 8 litres per second (LPS) ra te for about an hour.  The injection rate \nwas increased to 12 LPS and the test was continued for 90 minutes.  A drastic reduction in \n  \n  \n \nrecharge rate (3 LPS) was reported and the cause of reduction was attributed to \nbackpressure due to clogging of injection we ll.  Due to well clogging, the water level \ncould not reach to its initial st atic level even after 8 days.  Though, in this case, the silt-\nfree shallow ground water was used for recharge , the observational results clearly indicate \nthe necessity of understanding probable cl ogging problems which may arise due many \nother factors apart from silt entry. \n \n          Studies on control of salinity in the coastal Saurashtra using spreading and injection \nmethod have indicated that the recharge pit and the injection shaft can effect recharge at \nthe rate of 192 and 2600 cubic meters per da y respectively.  Canal water was used for \nrecharge studies. Problems in land acquisition in this highly developed area make it \ndifficult to select suitable sites for spreading structures. \n \n          A short period pressure inject ion was conducted by the Gujarat Water Resources \nDevelopment Corporation in 1974 near Ahmedaba d city.  Processed water from the city \nwater works was injected for 72 hours in a deep  tube well and a pre ssure varying between \n80-100 PSI with a rate of 45 litres per second. \n \n \n5.5 Artificial Recharge Studies In The Ghaggar River Basin  - Haryana: \n \nCentral Ground Water Board, with the assist ance of UNDP, has undertaken artificial \nrecharge studies involving indu ced recharge and recharge th rough injection wells at two \nsites located in the districts Ambala an d Kurukshetra along with Gh",

The Dabkheri site in the Narwana Branch area, Kurukshetra district was \nselected for the artificial recharge studies  by the injection well method after detailed \nhydrogeological surveys.  An in jection well tapping aquifer at  different depth levels was \ndeveloped with cement sealing from ground le vel to a depth of 15 m.  The injection \nexperiment was carried out using canal wate r with an injection rate of 43.3 LPS under \npressure.  It was observed that  the injection pre ssure of 1.6 atmosphe re raised to 1.96 \natmosphere within 30 minutes  of injection and remained constant for about 4 hours.  \nSudden and violent vibrations in the injection line were reported to have been witnessed \nand the injection pressure shot  up to 2.5 atmosphere and it wa s reported that it was due to \nclogging of foot valve with grass etc. \n \n            After construction and deve lopment of another injection well with improved \ndesign, second injection recharge experiment was conducted with a re charge rate of 40 \nLPS for 389 hours and with 22 LPS for another 24 hours.  The experiment demonstrated \nthat the hydrogeological condi tions of the area are favourab le for artificial recharge \nthrough injection method.  The canal water quality was found to be suitable for injection. \n \n \n5.6 Artificial Recharge In Moti Rayan And Bhujpur Area, Mandvi Kutch District \n \n           In order to augment the ground water reservoir in Moti Rayan area, 18 Check dams, \nthree percolation ponds, two recharge wells an d one sub surface dam w ith four recharge \nwells were constructed.

The third scheme of construc tion of percolation tanks and check dam is \nfeasible for the peripheral and outskirts regi on which are rural areas with plenty of open \nspace available. \n \n5.8.1  Roof top rainwater harvesting for ground water recharge \n \nIn Nagpur city roof top rain water expe riment was done in Ujjwal Nagar area \nwhere the roof top rain water collected from the concrete roof of 100 m3 was diverted into \nthe existing water supply dug well of the house hold. About 80,000 litres was recharged \nduring the monsoon. \n \n5.8.2 Run off rain water harvesting for ground water recharge in city area \n \n            The rainfall runoff flowing from the road s and open grounds is substantial during \nthe monsoon. This water often creates the wate r logging and the draina ge system is put \nunder stress in the urban agglomerates. This ul timately flows out of the city unutilised.  \nThis water if conserved and utilized properly for rechargi ng the ground water reservoir \nmay bring much needed relief to the water scar city areas of the city. One such scheme has \nbeen prepared by the Centra l Ground Water Board for Ujjw al Nagar of Nagpur.  The \ndesign and plan of the scheme is presented in Fig.-20.

During 1998,2427 Cubic Metres of rainwater was harvested and \nrecharged to ground water through propose built injection tubewells (Fig. 21). \n \n            The additional recharge to  ground water has resulted in  sustainable yield of \ntubewells already being operated. It is estimat ed that for effective impact roof area of \nabout 1000 sq.m. is required to harvest rain  water. However, this should be done by \nindividual house/flat owner and if done colle ctively the impact will be very significant. \n  \n  \n \nThe studies have shown that the ground water quality has improved \n          \n   \n5.10 Artificial Recharge To Ground Water In N.C.T. Delhi \n \n        In urban areas, dependence on ground water is high, resulting in depletion of \nground water resource. This necessitates replenishment of ground water reservoirs through \nartificial recharge by rainwater harvesting which involves inducing, collecting, storing and \nconserving local surface runoff. The CGWB ha s initiated pilot projects in Jawahar Lal \nNehru University (J.N.U.), Sanjay Van  for artificial recharge experiments.  \n \n       In J.N.U. and I.I.T. comprising of 5 micro watersheds, 0.46 Million Cubic Meters \n(MCM) storm water was going waste which coul d be stored in purpos",

Four check dams were constructed on \nrivulets and sixteen piezometers were establ ished to monitor the impact of artificial \nrecharge on ground water regime. The stor age capacity of 49,000 Cubic Meters was \ncreated in these dams and 1,25,000 Cubic Meters water had already been recharged to the \naquifer. Rise of water level maximum upto 4 m has been observed. Apart from sustainable \nyield of tubewells and more vegetation cove r around the check dams.

Indisc riminate extraction in Minjur - a coastal area \nalong the North Sea coast of Chennai, has been  spoiled because of over exploitation. The \nMetrowater is now taking up serious effort s to disseminate Rain Water Harvesting \ntechniques to the citizens of Chennai. In th e process, it has issued notifications to the \nbuilders who are constructing complexes with  1+3 floors to implement the Rain Water \nHarvesting measures. Chennai City receive s rainfall ranging from 1100 to 1200 per \nannum. As per statistics, a house on one ground plot (223 sq.m.) gets about 700 litres of \nwater a day by rainfall. Even in the case of multi-storied flats, where the effective space of \nper resident may be as small as 50 sq.m. , the rainfall corresponds to an amount of about \n100 to 150 litres per day.

Due to which the \nreservoir capacity has decreased and rechar ge through the water bodies have been \nminimised. It is proposed to enhance the rech arge rate by de-silting these water bodies. \nThis will result in rise in the water levels in the area.  \n \n \n5.37 Artificial recharge to ground water in District Purulia, West Bengal \n \nIn Purulia district cropping intensity is very high (116%).

The Irrigation is from \nsurface and ground water resource s. Principal rock types ar e Archean gneiss having 15 – \n20 m weathered mantle. Depth to water leve l varies from 4.00 to 11.00 m bgl. The water \nlevel fluctuation vary from 1 to 5 m. The ar ea has moderate to high slopes and bulk of \nrainfall is lost due to high run- off. Different types of artificia l recharge structures such as \nsub-surface dykes, Nalla bunds, tank excavation, re-excavation of existing minor irrigation \ntanks and contour bunding are being construc ted. The implementation of these schemes \nwill store the excess monsoon run off on the surface which other than supplying water for \nirrigation will also recharge the shallow unc onfined aquifer to create additional sub-\nsurface storage for further utilisation.  \n \n \n5.38  Artificial recharge to ground wa ter in Mainpura, District Jhunjhunu, \nRajasthan \n \nDue to excessive withdrawal of ground wa ter for industrial & irrigation purposes, \nthe area has experienced sharp decline in water level to the tune of 7.1 m in last 13 years \nand average decline in ground water level is 0.54 m /year. The stage of ground water \ndevelopment is 118.76 % in alluvium & 180.43 % in quartzite. The catchment of Kantli \nriver is 4667.8 Sq. Km and runoff availability is  93 MCM. For utilising the some part of \nthe available runoff for augmentation of ground water resources, one sub surface barrier  \nof 0.8 m. height, 2.75 m depth & 89 m long and th ree gravity head inverted wells of 1.2 m \ndia & 10 m. depth are being constructed \n \n  \n  \n \n5.39  Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting In C.G.W.B.

    "Office Premises, Jaipur \n \nDue to over development of ground water for domestic water supply in Jaipur the \nground water levels are continuously declining. Therefore for utilisi ng the roof top rain \nwater for recharge to ground water, the CGWB Office building at Jhalana Dungri at Jaipur \nis identified for experimental study. The roof top / paved area of the building is 1250 Sq. \nm.  The depth to ground water level is 29.0 m.bgl. The rate of decline is 1.10 m / year. The \nannual availability of water from roof top / paved area is 544 Cum.  For recharging the \navailable runoff an injection tubewell of 250 mm dia. and 50 m depth is being constructed \n(Fig- 33).  \n \n \n5.40  Artificial Recharge To Ground Wa ter Through Sub-Surface Dyke At Nallan \nPillai Patral, Gingee Block, Gingee Taluk, Villupuram District, Tamil Nadu \n \nThe project is located in a backward area having concen tration of landless labour. \nVillupuram district is severely affected by drought every year. Due to nature of the terrain \nand gradient of land, depletion of storage of water occurs at a very rapid rate and the entire \nzone becomes dry during summer. It is propos ed to tap ground water by constructing sub-\nsurface dyke. The length of dyke is expected to be about 100 m whereas depth is around \n3.50 – 7.00 m. The construction of dyke will result in better availability of water in the \ndug wells for a longer period even during summer months.  \n \n \n5.41  Artificial Recharge To Ground Water Through Sub-Surface Dyke, \nChirayinkil Block , Trivandrum District, Kerala \n \nThe area is located in Vamanpuram basi n, which is drained by a small nala in \nwhich base flow is availabl e upto mid-February only. Due to  drying up of the Nala the \narea faces acute water shortages during peak summer seasons. The average rainfall is 1963 \nmm of which about 70% is r eceived during south-western monsoon.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe increasing demand for water in the country has brought forward the realisation \nthat the underground reservoirs formed by the aquifers constitute invaluable water supply \nsources as well as natural water storage faci lities.  The planned augmentation of water \nstorage in the ground water reservoirs by suita ble recharge techniques is useful for \nreducing over-draft, conserving surface r unoff and increasing available ground water \nsupplies. Recharge may be incidental, when it is a by product of normal land and water \nutilisation measures and planned when the work  is carried out with the sole objective of \naugmenting ground water storage to improve wa ter availability or water quality, reduce \nimpact of floods or preventing/stopping sea water intrusion.  \n \nGround water recharge techni ques have been develope d world over through large \nnumber of experimental projects implemente d with diverse objectives.  Whereas the aim \nof majority of the projects was to augment ground water storage by utilizing surplus rainy \nseason flows or the waste waters; projects fo r beneficiation of wa ter quality, conserving \nsurface waters for subsequent use and stopping land subsidence were quite common.  In \nIndia, the applicability of technologies to tropical condi tions has been evaluated through a \nnumber of studies conducted by Central Gr ound Water Board and the State Ground Water \nOrganisations. \n \nThe experiences so gained form the base of this note to serve as guide for the \nevaluation of recharge schemes, now being conceived on a large scale in the States, before \ntheir sanction and implementation in order to derive the maximum returns on investments.  \nWhereas the main considerations will be the technical criteria, the expected financial",
    "in the States, before \ntheir sanction and implementation in order to derive the maximum returns on investments.  \nWhereas the main considerations will be the technical criteria, the expected financial \nbenefits can altogether not be lo st sight of.  It is, therefore, recommended that the rate at \n  \n  \n \nwhich the recharged water could be reclaime d must also be worked out for individual \nschemes. \n \nA well-planned recharge scheme will generally have three components. \n(i) Arrangement for source water. \n(ii) Well-designed structures to transfer the source water into the ground water \nreservoir. \n(iii) An Action Plan to use the stored ground water by suitable means. \n \nThe techno-economic viability of the project will thus depend on how best the cost \non each of the above components is kept at  minimum.  Whereas the detailed project \nplanning may have many permutations and comb inations with each option of the recharge \nscheme, the following may serve as a general guideline for planning: \n \n(i) Rock formation should be of moderate  permeability.  Low permeabilities reduce \nintake rate whereas high permeabilities do not allow retention of recharged water \nfor a longer time to make use of it during dry season. \n(ii) Basin development schemes, minor i rrigation tanks, afforestation, soil \nconservation schemes, are important sc hemes serving many other purposes in \naddition to augmenting recharge to the ground water reservoirs and hence are \npreferable. \n(iii) Injection wells or connector wells are costly schemes requiring high order of \nquality control and hence are not economically viable at this stage of time. \n(iv) Spreading methods have been found to be most economical structures. \n(v) Ground water dams are the most preferred c onservation measure as they need very \nlittle maintenance.  They are safe from natural catastrophe.  The evaporation losses \nare minimum and environmental problems arising out of stagnation are avoided. \n(vi) Availability of rainfall water fr",
    "tle maintenance.  They are safe from natural catastrophe.  The evaporation losses \nare minimum and environmental problems arising out of stagnation are avoided. \n(vi) Availability of rainfall water from the roof tops is so high that if properly used for \nartificial recharge (thr oughout the country) will not only increase ground water \navailability by will also help in reducing the problem of disposal of storm runoff in \ncities and towns. \n  \n  \n \n \n2. OBJECTIVES \n \nThe objectives of recharge schemes are generally the following: \n \n1. To augment the ground water resources. \n2. To store the surplus surface water particul arly during the flood periods for future \nuses and reduce the flood peaks. \n3. To retard the surface run off resulting in  lowering of flood peak, conserving the \nsoil by reducing soil erosion and improving the soil moisture retention for longer \nperiod to facilitate crop production and plant growth. \n4. To improve the quality of water stored.  When the source water passes through the \nsoil profile during the process of recharge, the soil mantle acts as membrane to the \ntravel of pathogen contained in the source water. \n5. To conserve the ground water at the point of use.  This is particularly suited to hard \nrock areas. \n6. To conserve thermal energy. \n7. To prevent saline intrusion in coastal aquifers. \n \n3. CONSIDERATIONS FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROJECTS \n(a) General Considerations: \n(i) Water availability. \n(ii) Favourable Topographic, Physiographic and Hydrogeologic set up. \n(iii) Infiltration and percolation characteristics of vadose zone. \n(iv) Hydrologic characteristics of the aqui fers such as capacity to store, \ntransmit and yield water. \n(v) Technical feasibility \n(vi) Economic viability. \n \n(b) General Recharge Methods \n(i) Water Spreading \n  \n  \n \n(ii) Water Injection (Recharge Wells) \n \n(iii) Induced Recharge \n(c) Characteristics of Basalts \nDark greenish-black, apparently homogeneous looking, basaltic rock of the \nDeccan occupies the",
    "(ii) Water Injection (Recharge Wells) \n \n(iii) Induced Recharge \n(c) Characteristics of Basalts \nDark greenish-black, apparently homogeneous looking, basaltic rock of the \nDeccan occupies the most extensive tract of  Western Peninsula covering large part \nof the States of Gujarat, Maharashtr a, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.  \nDeccan basalts popularly known as Deccan Trap consist of vast pile of lava flows \nlying over one another and include other volcanic products as tuffs, breccias, ash-\nbeds and sedimentary intertrappean deposits formed during the period between two \nlava flows.  The lava flow s have generally two distin ct horizons - Lower massive \nand Upper vesicular.  The massive part is  hard and compact whereas the vesicular \npart is characterised by vesi cles filled with secondary minerals (Amygdules).  The \nmassive traps are fractured and jointed at  places.  The weathering of massive and \nvesicular basalts form favourable loca les of surface and sub-surface water \ncirculation.  The cracks in the weathered z one are often filled with kankar.  An \ninteresting feature of the different basaltic lava flows is the contrast in their water \nbearing properties.  The massive basalts with their fracture porosities, the vesicular \nbasalts with their minutely interconnect ed and partly filled vesicles and \nintertrappean sediments with their primary porosities have all a decisive role to \nplay in determining the recharge capabili ties and suitable recharge structures of \ndifferent regions.  However, the recharge capacities of the rock types will be \ngreatly influenced by the overlying thickness,  texture and structure of the soils and \ntheir location with reference to topographic features. \n \nd) Recharge structures specific to Basaltic Terrain \n(i) Nala bunding \n(ii) Contour bunding \n(iii) Contour trenching \n(iv) Check dams \n(v) Pits and Shafts \n  \n  \n \n(vi) Percolation Tanks \n(vii) Surface channels/Trenches \n(viii) Groundwater dams \n \n4.

However, the followi ng considerations could act as guiding \nprinciples. \n \nHydrogeologic Region Weathered, fractured and vesicular basalts will \nconstitute most favourabl e hydrogeologic set-ups.  \n(These needs to be identified and marked on maps). \n \nTopography of Water-shed Area Piedmont slopes constitute the best environs \nfollowed by valley floors.  Highly dissected slopes \nand plateau tops are less favourable.  \n \nWater level fluctuations Areas with high water level fluctuations, de",
    "lopes constitute the best environs \nfollowed by valley floors.  Highly dissected slopes \nand plateau tops are less favourable.  \n \nWater level fluctuations Areas with high water level fluctuations, deep water \ntable and steeper hydraulic gradient will induce high \nrecharge rates. \n \nHydraulic conductivity Weathered, jointed a nd vesicular basalts are \nexpected to have high hydraulic conductivity and \nwill constitute favourable environs in comparison \nwith massive basalts which are less susceptible to \nrecharge augmentation. \n \nThickness of soil cover and  Granular soil cover will have high infiltration rate in  \n  \n  \n \nInfiltration rate comparison to fine clay/matrix.  Black cotton soil \nderived from lava flow covering extensive  area is \nclayey and highly calcar eous and would impede \nrecharge. \n \nAquifer Type Phreatic aquifers will re ceive recharged water more \neasily than confined systems.  In the vesicular basalts \nand jointed basalts, the calcareous material filling the \nvesicles, cavities and joints can subsequently be \ndissolved by recharged water.  This tends to \naccelerate the recharge rate. \n \nHydraulic conductivity of Infiltration and percolation rate of unsaturated zone  \nUnsaturated rock in the zone  will contribute to accelerated recharge. \nof Aeration \n \nProfile of vertical recharge The unsaturated zone should as far as possible be  \nupto unsaturated zone. free from thick clay beds. \n \nRate of Recharge In favourable conditions  vesicular and fractured \nbasalt are expected to attain a recharge @ 10% - \n15%, whereas in non-favourable physiographic \nlocales underlain by massive basalt, the rate may be \nas low as 2 - 3%. \n \nQuantitative assessment Pre-Recharge Ground Water Balance of Aquifer  \nof ground water system. \n \n Post-Recharge Ground Water Balance of Aquifer \nsystem. \n \ng.

Km. The \nGround Water available in the territory is controlled by the hydrogeological situation \ncharacterized by occurrence of alluvial formation and hard rocks such as quartzite. The \nhydrogeological set up and the following distinct physiographic units further influence \nthe ground water occurrence: (1) Older Alluvial Plain on the eastern and western side of \nthe ridge. (2) Yamuna Flood Plain deposits. (3) Isolated nd nearly closed Chattarpur \nalluvial basin. (4) NNE-SSW trending Quartzite Ridge. \n \n The high rate of population growth and high level of urbanization in NCT Delhi \nha s resulted in over development of ground water resources. Thus in about 75% area of \nNCT Delhi ground water levels are  declining at an alarming rate of 0.40 m per annum. \nIn South and Southwest district the decline is high varying from 1 to 2 m/Yr. The \nannual replenishable ground water resources of the State is 0.31 bcm with a net annual \nground water availability of 0.29 bcm. Ground water draft (as on 31 st March 2009) is \n0.40 bcm with a stage of ground water development of 138%. Out of the 27 assessment \nunits (Tehsils) in the State, 20 have been categorized as over exploited, 05 semi critical \nand 02 have been categorized as safe from ground water development point of view. \n \n In view of high state of ground water development, and depletion of ground water \nlevels due to its over development Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) had \nnotified South and South -West district vide Public Notice No. 6 of 2000 dated \n15.08.2000 and imposed prohibiti on and restriction for construction and installation of \nany structure for abstraction of ground water resources to avoid further depletion and \ndeterioration of ground water",
    "000 and imposed prohibiti on and restriction for construction and installation of \nany structure for abstraction of ground water resources to avoid further depletion and \ndeterioration of ground water quality. Subsequently the Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor \nhad declared the whole NCT De lhi as notified on 31.03.2009 vide order No. F8 \n(348)/EA/Env/09/14433. \n \n The normal annual rai nfall of NCT Delhi is 611.8 mm out of which 81% of the \nannual rainfall is received during the monsoon months July, August and September.  \nThe rest of the annual r ainfall is received as winter rain and as thunderstorm rain in the \npre and post monsoon months.  \n \n In order to increase the natural ground water resource rain water harvesting and \nartificial recharge to ground water has become increasingly important in gro und water \nmanagement. The subsurface geology, post monsoon depth to water level and declining \nground water level conditions of the State indicate that the area is suitable for artificial \nrecharge. The favorable aquifer zones down to depth of ground water l evel which is \nlying unsaturated presently may be suitable recharged through rain water harvesting. \n \n For the convenience of general public standard designs of Rainwater Harvesting \nhave been prepared and placed on CGWB website. \n \n Permission to install vario us Artificial Recharge Structures and Recharge \nwells is governed by the prevailing rules and laws in the area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tehsil wise Rain Water Harvesting Structures in NCT Delhi \n* Feasible where water level is more than 5 meter below ground level.  \n \nSl \nNo. \nTehsil Recommended  \nharvesting structures \nDepth of recharge \nwell (meter) \nRemarks \n District: New Delhi    \n1 Chanakyapuri Trench with bore 18  \n2 Connaught place Only Trench -  \n3 Parliament Street Trench with bore 18  \n District: North West    \n4 Model Town Only Trench -  \n5 Narela Only Trench -  \n6 SaraswatiVihar Only Trench -  \n District: West    \n7 Patel Nagar Trench with bore 15",

Artificial recharge  techniques normally address to following \nissues - \n \n(i) To enhance the sustainable yield in areas where over-development has depleted the \naquifer. \n \n(ii) Conservation and storage of excess surface  water for future requirements, since \nthese requirements often changes within a season or a period. \n \n(iii) To improve the quality of existing ground water through dilution. \n \n(iv) To remove bacteriological and other impur ities from sewage and waste water so \nthat water is suitable for re-use. \n \nThe basic purpose of artificial recharge of  ground water is to restore supplies from \naquifers depleted due to excessive ground water development. \n \n \n1.1        Concept of Augmenting Ground Water Reservoir \n \n1.1.1 Ground Water or Sub-Surface Reservoirs \n \nThe sub-surface reservoirs are",

The su b-surface reservoirs can store substantial \nquantity of water. The sub-surface geolog ical formations may be considered as \n\"warehouse\" for storing water that come from sources located on the land surface. Besides \nsuitable lithological condition, other consider ations for creating sub-surface storages are \nfavourable geological structur es and physiographic units, w hose dimensions and shape \nwill allow retention of substantial volume of water in porous and permeable formations. \n \nThe sub-surface reservoirs, located in suitable hydrogeological situations, are \nenvironment friendly and economically viable  proposition. The sub-surface storages have \nadvantages of being free from the adverse effects like inundation of large surface area, \nloss of cultivable land, displacement of local  population, substantia l evaporation losses \nand sensitivity to earthquakes. No gigantic structures are needed to store water. The \nunderground storage of water would also have  beneficial influence on the existing ground \nwater regime. The deeper water levels in ma ny parts of the country, either of natural \noccurrence or due to excessive  ground water development, may be substantially raised, \nresulting in reduction in lifti ng costs and energy saving. Th e quality of natural ground \n  \n  \n \nwater would substantially improve in brackis h and saline areas. Th e conduit function of \naquifers thereby reducing the cost inte nsive surface water conveyance system.

    "h sub-surface stor age at various surface intersection points in \nthe form of spring line, or stream emergen ce, would enhance the river flows and improve \nthe presently degraded ecosystem of riverine tracts, particularly in the outfall areas. The \nstructures required for rechar ging ground water reservoirs ar e of small dimensions and \ncost effective, such as check dams, percola tion tanks, surface spreading basins, pits, sub-\nsurface dykes etc. \n \n \n1.1.2  Basic Requirement for Arti ficial Recharge Projects \n \nThe basic requirements for recharging the ground water reservoir are: \n \na) Availability of non-committed surplus monsoon run off in space and time. \n \nb) Identification of suitable hydrogeological environment and sites for creating sub-\nsurface reservoir through cost effective artificial recharge techniques. \n \n \n1.1.3  Source Water Availability \n \nThe availability of source water, one of the prime requisites for ground water \nrecharge, is basically assessed in terms of  non committed surplus monsoon run off, which \nas per present water resource development sc enario is going unutilised. This component \ncan be assessed by analysing the monsoon rain fall pattern, its frequency, number of rainy \ndays, maximum rainfall in a day and its variat ion in space and time. The variations in \nrainfall pattern in space and time, and its relevance in relation to the scope for artificial \nrecharge to sub-surface rese rvoirs can be considered fo r assessing the surplus surface \nwater availability. \n \n \n1.1.4 Hydrogeological Aspects \n \nDetailed knowledge of geological and hydrological features of the area is \nnecessary for adequately selecting the site and th e type of recharge structure. In particular, \nthe features, parameters and  data to be considered are: geologi cal boundaries; hydraulic \nboundaries; inflow and outflow  of waters; storage cap acity; porosity; hydraulic \nconductivity; transmissiv ity; natural discharge of springs ; water resources available for \nrechar",
    "aries; hydraulic \nboundaries; inflow and outflow  of waters; storage cap acity; porosity; hydraulic \nconductivity; transmissiv ity; natural discharge of springs ; water resources available for \nrecharge; natural recharge; wa ter balance; lithology; depth of the aquifer; and tectonic \nboundaries. The aquifers best suited for artificial recharge are those aquifers which absorb \nlarge quantities of water and do not release them too quickly. Theoretically this will imply \nthat the vertical hydraulic conductivity is high, while the horizontal hydraulic conductivity \nis moderate. These two conditions are not often encountered in nature.  \n \n  \n  \n \nThe evaluation of the storage potential of sub-surface reservoirs is invariably based \non the knowledge of dimensional data of rese rvoir rock, which includes their thickness \nand lateral extent.  The avai lability of sub-surface storage space and its replenishment \ncapacity further govern the extent of rechar ge. The hydrogeological si tuation in each area \nneeds to be appraised with a view to asse ss the recharge capabilities of the underlying \nhydrogeological formations.  The unsaturated  thickness of rock fo rmations, occurring \nbeyond three meters below ground level should be  considered to assess the requirement of \nwater to build up the sub-surface storage by sa turating the entire thickness of the vadose \nup to 3 m. below ground level. \n \nThe upper 3 m of the unsaturated zone is not considered for recharging, since it \nmay cause adverse environmental impact e.g. water logging, soil salinity, etc. The post-\nmonsoon depth to water level represents a situ ation of minimum thickness of vadose zone \navailable for recharge which can be consider ed vis-a-vis surplus monsoon run off in the \narea. \n \nThe artificial recharge techniques inter re late land integrate the source water to \nground water reservoir.

Two effects are gene rated by artificial rech arge in ground water \nreservoir namely - (a) Rise in water level and (b) increment in the total volume of the \nground water reservoir. \n \n \n2.0  PLANNING OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE PROJECTS \n \n2.1 Identification Area \n \nThe artificial recharge projects are site  specific and even the replication of the \ntechniques from similar areas are to be based on the local hydrogeological and \nhydrological environments. The first step in pl anning the project is to demarcate the area \nof recharge. The Project can be implemente d systematically in case a hydrologic unit like \nwatershed is taken for implementation. Howeve r, localised schemes are also taken to \naugment ground water reservoir. The artificial recharge of ground water is normally taken \nin following areas: \n \n1.        Areas where ground water levels are declining on regular basis. \n2.       Areas where substantial amount of aquifer has already been desaturated. \n3.       Areas where availability of ground water is inadequate in lean months. \n4.       Areas where salinity ingress is taking place. \n \n \n2.2 Scientific Inputs \n   \nIn order to plan the artificial recharge schemes following studies are needed \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n2.2.1 Hydrometeorological Studies   \n \nThese are undertaken to decipher the ra infall pattern, evaporation losses and \nclimatological features.  These can bring out  the extent of evaporation losses in post \nmonsoon period which would be helpful in desi gning the storages of particular capacity \nwith a view to have minimum evaporation losses. In semi arid regions of India, \nevaporation losses are significant after January hence the stored water should percolate to \nground water reservoir by this period.

The data  on rainfall intensity, number of rain-days, \netc. help in deciding the capacity and design of the artificial recharge structures. \n \n \n2.2.2 Hydrological Studies              \n \nBefore undertaking any artificial recharge project, it is a basic prerequisite to \nascertain the availability of source water for the purpose of recharging the ground water \nreservoir. For determining the source water availability for artificial recharge, hydrological \ninvestigations are required to  be carried out in the Waters hed/Sub-basin/basin where the \nartificial recharge schemes are envisaged. Four  types of source water may be available for \nartificial recharge viz. \n \n(i) Insitu precipitation on the watershed. \n(ii) Surface (canal) supplies from large reservoirs located within basin \n(iii) Surface supplies through trans basin water transfer. \n(iv) Treated municipal and industrial wastewaters. \n \n'In situ' precipitation will be available almo st at every location but may or may not \nbe adequate to cause artificial recharge  but the runoff going unut ilised outside the \nwatershed/ basin can be stored/ transmitte d through simple recharge structures at \nappropriate locations. In addition none, one or both of the other two sources may be \navailable in any of the situations, the following information will be required: \n \na) The quantity that may be diverted for artificial recharge. \nb) The time for which the source water will be available. \nc) The quality of source water and the pretreatment required. \nd) Conveyance system required to bring the water to the recharge site. \n \nHydrological studies are undertaken to work out surplus monsoon run off which \ncan be harnessed as source water for artificial recharge. \n \n \n2.2.3  Soil Infiltration Studies  \n \nIn case of artificia l recharge through water spreading methods, soil and Land use \nconditions which control the rate of infiltr ation and downward percolation of the water \napplied on the surface of the soil as",
    "artificia l recharge through water spreading methods, soil and Land use \nconditions which control the rate of infiltr ation and downward percolation of the water \napplied on the surface of the soil assume special importance. Infiltration in its most narrow \nand precise sense can be defined as \"The process water entering into a soil through the soil \n  \n  \n \nsurface\". Although a distinction is made be tween infiltration and percolation (the \nmovement of water within the soil) th e two phenomena are closely related since \ninfiltration cannot continue unimpeded unless percolation removes in filtrated water from \nthe surface soil. The soil is permeated by non capillary channel through which gravity \nwater flows downward towards the ground water, following the path of least resistance. \nCapillary forces continuously divert gravity water into  pore spaces, so that the quantity of \ngravity water passing successively lower horizons  is steadily diminished. This leads to \nincreasing resistance to gravity flow in the surface layer and a decreasing rate of \ninfiltration as a storm progresses. The rate of infiltration in the early phases of a storm is \nless if the capillary pores are filed from a previous storm. \n \nThere is maximum rate at which water can enter soil at a particular point under a \ngiven set of conditions, this rate is called th e infiltration capacity. The actual infiltration \nrate equals the infiltration capacity only when the supply rate rainfall intensity less rate of \nretention) equals or exceeds. \n \nInfiltration capacity depends on many factors such as soil type, moisture content, \norganic matter, vegetative cover, season, ai r entrapment, formation of surface seals or \ncrusts etc. Of the soil ch aracteristics affecting infiltra tion, non-capillary porosity is \nperhaps the most important.

    "perhaps the most important. Porosity dete rmines storage capacity and also effects \nresistance to flow. Thus infiltration tends  to increase with porosity. Vegetal cover \nincreases infiltration as compared with ba rren soil because (i) it retards surface flow \ngiving the water additional time to enter the so il (ii) the root system make the soil more \npervious and (iii) the foliage shields the so il from raindrop impact and reduces rain \npacking of surface soil. As water infiltrate s soil under natural condi tions the displacement \nof air is not complete even after many hours. Air spaces in the soil and intermediate zones \ninterfere with infiltration as air is not pushe d out by the infiltrating water but is gradually \nabsorbed by water. Due to this phenomena infiltration rate may start rising towards a new \nhigh after a few days of continuous applic ation of water. Surface conditions have a \nmarked effect on the infiltration process and the formation of surface seals or crusts which \nforms under the influence of external forces such as rain drop impact and mechanical \ncompaction or through staking reduces the rate of infiltration. \n \nInfiltration of wate r through surface takes place ge nerally over small periods of \ntime and it is the process of redistribution of the soil water that goes on for most of the \ntime and therefore predominates. When ra infall ceases the water wetted during the \ninfiltration process starts to drain with th e soil being wetted lower down the profile. The \nsoil water conditions during the distribution periods are therefore those that primarily \ninfluence plant growth and agricultural husband ry and that also provide the buffer action \nin hydrologic cycle that the soil water zones has on the transport of water from the soil \nsurface to the ground water aquifer. As such, inf iltration is critically inter-linked with the \nphenomena of water evolution in the vadose zone which includes wetting front \npropagation. \n \n In order to know infiltra",

As such, inf iltration is critically inter-linked with the \nphenomena of water evolution in the vadose zone which includes wetting front \npropagation. \n \n In order to know infiltration rates of soils  infiltration tests are carried out.  Cylinder \nor flood infiltro-meters are common type of instruments which measure the infiltration as \n  \n  \n \nthe rate of water leaving the de vice.   Map showing infiltration rates of soils are prepared.  \nThese help to design suitable artificial rechar ge structures and to assess the extent of \nrecharge from these structures. \n \n \n2.2.4 Hydrogeological Studies  \n \nA correct understanding of  hydrogeology of an area is of prime importance in \nsuccessful implementation of any Artificial Rech arge scheme. A desirabl e first step is to \nsynthesize all the available data on hydrogeolog y from different agencies. The regional \ngeological maps indicate the location of differ ent geological strata, their geological age \nsequence, boundaries/contacts of individual form ations and the struct ural expressions like \nStrike, Dip, Faults, Folds, Flexures, Intrusive bodies etc.  These maps also bring out \ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts. \n \nThe Map providing information on region al hydrogeological rock units, their \nground water potential and general pattern of ground water flow and chemical quality of \nwater in different aquifers are necessary. \n \nSatellite Imagery maps provides useful data on geomorphic units and lineaments \nwhich govern the occurrence and movement of ground water. \n \nA detailed hydrogeological study besides the regional picture of hydrogeological \nset up available from previous studies is th erefore imperative to know precisely the \npromising hydrogeological units for recharge and correctly decide on the location and type \nof structures to be constructed in field. \n \nThe hydrogeological investigations required before implementation of an artificial \nrecharge scheme are given b",
    "correctly decide on the location and type \nof structures to be constructed in field. \n \nThe hydrogeological investigations required before implementation of an artificial \nrecharge scheme are given below. \n \n(i) Detailed Hydrogeological Mapping \nThe purpose of hydrogeological mapping is to present the following maps which \nfacilitate in the analysis of the ground water re gime and its suitability to artificial recharge \nschemes. \n \na) Map showing hydrogeological units demarcated on the basis of their water bearing \ncapabilities, both at shallow and deeper levels. \nb) Map showing ground water contours to determine the form of the water table and \nthe hydraulic connection of ground water with rivers, canals etc. \nc) Map showing the depths to the water tabl e are usually compiled for the periods of \nthe maximum, minimum and mean annual position of water table. \nd) Maps that show amplitudes of ground water level fluctuations and the maximum \nposition of the water table of considerab le importance for artificial recharge \nstudies. \ne) Maps showing piezometric head in deeper aquifers and their variations with time. \n \n  \n  \n \nf) Maps showing ground water potential of different hydrogeologi cal units and the \nlevel of ground water development. \ng) Maps showing chemical quality of ground water in different aquifers. \n \nThe usefulness of all the above interpre tative maps is additive, i.e. their \nconjunctive usage allow greater knowledge and understanding of an area than when a map \nis used separately. \n \nAt this level of hydrogeological mappi ng of the area few questions should be \nanswered, \n \n1. Whether there is any gap in data on sub-surface geology of the available \nlithological logs of the boreholes in the ar ea are sufficient to arrive at a correct \npicture of aquifer geometry of the area. \n \n2.

Whether the available data on aquifer para meters is sufficient in case the area \nshows promise for artificial recharge techniques for deeper aquifers through \nInjection well etc. \n \n3. Can the available ground water structur e serve the purpose of monitoring the \neffects of artificial recharge Project \n \nAquifer Geometry : The data on the sub-surface hydrogeological units, their \nthickness and depth of occurrence, and to  bring out the dis position and hydraulic \nproperties of unconfined , semi-confined and c onfined aquifers in the area.  For surface \nwater spreading techniques the area of interest  is generally restricted to shallow depths. \nThe main stress is on knowing whether the su rface rock types are sufficiently permeable \nor not to maintain high rate of infiltration during the artificial recharge.  \n \n \n2.2.5 Geophysical Studies  \n \na) The main purpose of applying geophysical methods for the selection of appropriate \nsite for artificial recharge studies is  mostly to help and assess the unknown sub-\nsurface hydrogeological conditions economi cally, adequately and unambiguously. \nGenerally the prime task is to compliment  the exploratory programme. Mostly it is \nemployed to narrow down the target zone, pinp oint the probable site for artificial \nrecharge structure and its proper design. \n \nb) Nevertheless, the application of geophysical methods is to bring out a comparative \npicture of the sub-surface litho environm ent, surface manifestation of such \nstructures, and correlate them with the hydrogeological setting. \n \nc) Besides defining the sub-surface structure and lithology, it can identify the \nbrackish/fresh ground water interface, cont aminated zone (saline) and the area \nprone to seawater intrusion. \n  \n  \n \nUsing certain common geophysical methods, it is possible to model the  \n \ni) Stratification of aquifer system and spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity \nof the characteristic zone, suitable for artificial rechar",

They are also related to \nthe changes in the soil structure and the bi ological phenomena which take place when \ninfiltration begins, to the changes brought to  the environmental conditions. The chemical \nand bacteriological analysis of source wate r besides that of gr ound water is therefore \nessential. \n \n \n2.2.7 Suspended matter may clog the soil in two different ways \n \nSuspended Solids and Clogging Problem: A major requirement for waters that are \nto be used in recharge projects is that they be silt-free. Silt may be defined as the content \nof undissolved solid matter, usually measured in mg/l, which settles in stagnant water with \nvelocities which do not exceed 0.1 m/hr. To obta in still clearer water, with only 10 - 12 \nmg/l suspended solids, further additions of flocculants and, frequently, agitation of the \nwater must be resorted to",
    "es which do not exceed 0.1 m/hr. To obta in still clearer water, with only 10 - 12 \nmg/l suspended solids, further additions of flocculants and, frequently, agitation of the \nwater must be resorted to. \n \n \nFirst, near the surface the interstices of the soil may be filled up and a layer of mud \nmay be deposited on the surface, on the other hand suspended particles may penetrate \ndeeper into the soil and accumulate there. \n \n  \n  \n \nMethods to minimize the clogging effect by suspended matter can be classified \ninto broad groups: \n \na) Periodical removing of the mud-cake and dicing or scraping of the surface layer. \n \nb) Installation of a filter on th e surface, the permeability of  which is lower than that \nof the natural strata (the filter mu st, of course, be removed and renewed \nperiodically) \n \nc) Addition of organic matter or chemicals to the uppermost layer. \n \nd) Cultivation of certain plant-covers, notably certain kinds of grass. \n \nProviding inverted filter consisting of fine sand coarse sand and gravel at the \nbottom of infiltration pits/trenches are very effective. \n \nClogging by biological activity depends upon the mineralogical and organic \ncomposition of the water and basin floor and upon the grain-size and permeability of the \nfloor. The only feasible method of treatment developed so far consists in thoroughly \ndrying the ground under the basin. \n \n \n2.3 Assessment Of Sub-Surface Potential For Ground Water  Recharge  \n \nBased on the hydrogeological and geophysical surveys, the thickness of potential \nunsaturated zone for recharge should be work ed out to assess the potential for artificial \nrecharge in terms of volume of water which can be accommodated in this zone vis-à-vis \nsource water availability. The studies should br ing out the potential of unsaturated zone in \nterms of total volume which can be recharged.       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n3.0      ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE TECHNIQUES AND DESIGNS \n \nA wide spectrum of techniques are in vogue to",

The artificial recharge techniques can be broadly categorised as follows:-  \n \na. Direct surface techniques \n• Flooding \n• Basins or percolation tanks \n• Stream augmentation \n• Ditch and furrow system \n• Over irrigation \n \nb. Direct sub surface techniques \n• Injection wells or recharge wells \n• Recharge pits and shafts \n• Dug well recharge \n• Bore hole flooding \n• Natural openings, cavity fillings. \n \nc. Combination surface – sub-surface techniques \n• Basin or percolation tanks with pit shaft or wells. \n \nd. Indirect Techniques \n• Induced recharge from surface water source. \n• Aquifer modification. \n \nBesides above, the ground water conser vation structures like ground water dams, \nsub-surface dykes or locally termed as Bandharas,  are quite prevalent to arrest sub-surface \nflows.  Similarly in hard rock areas rock fr acturing techniques including sectional blasting \nof boreholes with suitable techniques has been  applied to inter-connect the fractures and \nincrease recharge.  Cement sealing of fractures, through sp ecially constructed bore well \nhas been utilised in Maharashtra to cons erve sub-surface flow and augment bore well \nyield. (A schematic diagram of these is given in Fig. 1). \n \n \n3.1 Artificial Recharge Structures \n \n3.1.1 Ditch and Furrow Method:  \n \nIn areas with irregular topography, shallow, flat bottomed and closely spaced \nditches or furrows provide maximum water c ontact area for recharge water from source \nstream or canal.  This technique requires less soil preparation than the recharge basins and \nis less sensitive to silting.  Fig. 2 shows a typi cal plan or series of ditches originating from \na supply d",
    "eam or canal.  This technique requires less soil preparation than the recharge basins and \nis less sensitive to silting.  Fig. 2 shows a typi cal plan or series of ditches originating from \na supply ditch and trending dow n the topographic slope towa rds the stream.  Generally \nthree patterns of ditch and furrow system are adopted. \n  \n  \n \n \n3.1.1.1 Lateral Ditch Pattern \n \n The water from stream is diverted to the feeder canal/ditch from which smaller \nditches are made at right angles .  The rate of flow of water from the feeder canal to these \nditches is controlled by gate valves.  The furrow depth is kept according to the topography \nand also with the aim that maximum wetted surface is available along with maintenance of \nuniform velocity.  The excess water is routed  to the main stream through a return canal \nalong with residual silt. \n \n \n3.1.1.2 Dendritic Pattern \n \nThe water from stream can be diverted from  the main canal to a series of smaller \nditches spread in a dendritic pattern.  The bifu rcation of ditches continues until practically \nall the water is infiltrated in the ground. \n \n \n3.1.1.3   Contour Pattern \n \nThe ditches are excavated following the ground surface contour of the area.  When \nthe ditch comes closer to the stream a switch back is made and thus the ditch is made to \nmeander back and forth to traverse the spread  are repeatedly.  At the lowest point down \nstream, the ditch joins the main stream, thus returning the excess water to it. \n \n \n3.1.1.4  Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines \n \na. Although this method is adaptable to irre gular terrain, the water contact area \nseldom exceeds 10 percent of the total recharge area. \nb.    Ditches should have slope to mainta in flow velocity and minimum deposition \n  of  sediments.  \nc. Ditches should be shallow, flat-bottomed, and closely spaced to obtain.             \nMaximum water contact area.  Width of 0.3 to 1.8 m. are typical \nd.

A collecting ditch to convey the excess water back to the main stream channel \nshould be provided. \n \n     \n3.1.2  Percolation Tanks (PT) / Spreading Basin \n \nThese are the most prevalent structures in India as a measure to recharge the \nground water reservoir both in al luvial as well as hard rock  formations.  The efficacy and \nfeasibility of these structures is more in hard rock formation where the rocks are highly \nfractured and weathered.  In the States of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, \nKarnataka and Gujarat, the percolation tanks ha ve been constructed in plenty in basaltic \nlava flows and crystalline rocks. A typical design of PT is given in Fig. 3 The percolation \n  \n  \n \ntanks are however also feasible in mountain fronts occupied by talus scree deposits.  These \nare found to be very effective in Satpura Mountain front area in  Maharashtra.  The \npercolation tanks can also be constructed in the Bhabar zone. Percolation tanks with wells \nand shafts Percolation tanks are also constr ucted to recharge deeper aquifers where \nshallow or superficial formations are hi ghly impermeable or clayey with certain \nmodification.  Recharge wells with filter are constructed in the Percolation Tanks and the \nstored water is Moti Ranjan and Bhujpur, Mandvi Kutch district, Gujarat. \n \n3.1.2.1 Important Aspects of Percolation Tanks: \n \na. A detailed analysis of rainfall patter n, number of rainy days, dry spells, and \nevaporation rate and detailed hydrogeol ogical studies to demarcate suitable \npercolation tank sites. \n \nb.

Percolation tanks be normally constructed on second to third order stream since the \ncatchment so also the submergence area would be smaller. \n \nd. The submergence area should be in uncultivable land as far as possible. \n \ne. Percolation tank be located on highly fr actured and weathered rock for speedy \nrecharge.  In case of alluvium, the bouldary formations are ideal for locating \nPercolation Tanks. \n \nf. The aquifer to be recharge should have sufficient thickness of permeable vadose \nzone to accommodate recharge. \n \ng. The benefitted area should have sufficient number of wells and cultivable land to \ndevelop the recharge water. \n \nh. Detailed hydrological studies  for run off assessment be done and design capacity \nshould not normally be more than 50% of total quantum of rainfall in catchment. \n \ni. Waste weir or spillway be suitably designed to allow flow of surplus water based \non single day maximum rainfall after the rank is filled to its maximum capacity. \n \nj. Cut off trench be provided to minimise seepage losses both below and above nalla \nbed. \n \nk. To avoid erosion of embankment due to ripple action stone pitching be provided \nupstream upto HFL. \n \nl. Monitoring mechanism in benefitted as well as catchment area using observation  \n  \n  \n \n well and staff gauges be provided to assess the impact and benefits of percolation  tank. \n \n \n3.1.3 Check Dams Cement Plug  nala bunds \n \n Check dams are constructed across sm all streams having gentle slope and are \nfeasible both in hard rock as well as alluvi al formation.  The site selected for check dam \nshould have sufficient thickness of permeable bed or weathered form ation to facilitate \nrecharge of stored water within short span of time.  The water stored in these structures is \nmostly confined to stream course and the height is normally less than 2 m.  These are \ndesigned based on s",

These are \ndesigned based on stream width and excess wate r is allowed to flow over the wall.  In \norder to avoid scouring from excess run o ff, water cushions are provided at down \nstreamside.  To harness the maximum run off in  the stream, series of such check dams can \nbe constructed to have recharge on regional scale. \n \n A series of small bunds or weirs are made across selected nala sections such that \nthe flow of surface water in the stream channel is impede d and water is retained on \npervious soil/tock surface for longer body. Na la bunds are constructed across bigger nalas \nof second order streams in areas having gent ler slopes.  A nala bund acts like a mini \npercolation tank. The design aspects of check dam/Cement plug are given in Fig. 4. \n \nSite Characteristic and Design Guidelines :  For selecting a site for Check Dams/Nala \nbunds the following conditions may be observed. \n \n1. The total catchment of the nala sh ould normally be between 40 to 100 \nHectares. though the local situations can be guiding factor in this. \n \n2. The rainfall in the catchment should be less than 1000 mm/annum. \n \n3. The width of nala bed should be atleast 5 metres and not exceed 15 metres \nand the depth of bed should not be less than 1 metre. \n \n4. The soil down stream of the bund shoul d not be prone to water logging and \nshould have pH between 6.5 to 8. \n \n5. The lands downstream of Check Da m/bund should have irrigable land \nunder well irrigation. \n \n6. The Nala bunds should be preferable located in area where contour or \ngraded bunding or lands have been carried out. \n \n7. The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately permeable \nto cause ground water recharge through ponded water. \n \n8.

Nala bund is generally a small earthen dam, with a cut off core wall of \nbrick work, though cement bunds/plugs are now  prevalent. \n  \n  \n \n \n9. For the foundation for core wall a trench is dug 0.6 m wide in hard rock or \n1.2 metres in soft rock of impervious nature.  A core brick cement wall is \nerected 0.6 m wide to stand atleast 2.5 metres above nala bed and the \nremaining portion of trench is back filled on upstream side by impervious \nclay.  The core wall is buttressed on  both sides by a bund made up of local \nclays and on the upstream face, stone pitching is done. \n \n10. Normally the final dimensions of the Nala bund are; length 10 to 15 metres, \nheight 2 to 3 metres and width 1 to 3 metres, generally constructed in a \ntrapezoidal form.  If the bedrock is  highly fractured, cement grouting is \ndone to make the foundation leakage free. \n \n The check dams are also popular and feas ible in Bhabar, Kandi and talus scree \nareas of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Mahara shtra and have substantial impact on \naugmentation of ground water.  \n \n \n3.1.4. Gabion Structure \n \nThis is a kind of check dam being comm only constructed across small stream to \nconserve stream flows with  practically no submergence beyond stream course.  The \nboulders locally available are stored in a stee l wire.  This is put up across the stream's \nmesh to make it as a small dam by anchoring it to the streamside (fig 5).  The height of \nsuch structures is around 0.5 m and is normally used in the streams with width of about 10 \nto 15 m.  The cost of such structures is around Rs.10 to 15000/-.  The excess water \noverflows this structure storing some water to serve as source of recharge.  The silt \ncontent of stream water in due  course is deposited in the interstices of the boulders to \nmake it more impermeable.

Modification of Village tanks as recharge structure \n \n The existing village tanks which are normally silted and damaged can be modified \nto serve as recharge structure.  In genera l no “Cut Off Trench” (COT) and Waste Weir is \nprovided for village tanks.  Desilting, coupl ed with providing proper waste weir and \nC.O.T. on the upstream side, the village tanks can be converte d into recharge structure. \nSeveral such tanks are available which can  be modified for enhancing ground water \nrecharge. Some of the tanks in Maharashtra and Karnataka have been converted. \n \n \n3.1.6. Inter Watershed Transfer \n \n The percolation tanks in a watershed may not have enough catchment discharge \nthough a high capacity tank is possi ble as per site c onditions.  In such situations stream \n  \n  \n \nfrom nearby watershed can be diverted with  some additional cost and the tank can be \nmade more efficient.  Such an effort was made in Satpura Mountain front area at Nagadevi \nJalgaon district, Maharashtra.   The existing capacity of the tank of 350 TMC was never \nutilised after its cons truction. This could however be fi lled by stream diversion from \nadjacent watershed. \n \n3.1.7 Dug Well Recharge \n \n In alluvial as well as hard rock areas, there are thousands of dug wells which have \neither gone dry or the water levels have d eclined considerably.  These dug wells can be \nused as structures to rechar ge (Fig 6 & 7). The ground water reservoir, storm water, tank \nwater, canal water etc. can be diverted into th ese structures to direc tly recharge the dried \naquifer.

The quality of sour ce water including the silt cont ent should be such that the \nquality of ground water reservoir is not dete riorated. Schematic diagrams of dug well \nrecharge are given in figures 6 &7. \n \n \n3.1.8 Recharge Shaft \n These are the most efficient and cost eff ective structures to recharge the aquifer \ndirectly. In the areas where source of water is available either for some time or perennially \ne.g. base flow, springs etc. the recharge shaf t can be constructed (Fig 8).  Following are \nsite characteristics and design guidelines: - \n \n(i) To be dug manually of the strata is non-caving nature. \n(ii) If the strata is caving, proper permeable lining in the form of open work, boulder \nlining are should be provided. \n(iii) The diameter of shaft should normally be more than 2 m to accommodate more \nwater and to avoid eddies in the well. \n(iv) In the areas where source water is having silt, the shaft should be filled with \nboulder, good and sand from bottom to have inverted filler.  The upper most sandy \nlayer has to be removed and cleaned periodically. A filter be provided before the \nsource water enters the shaft. \n(v) When water is put into the recharge shaft directly th rough pipes, air bubbles are \nalso sucked into the shaft through the pipe which can choke the aquifer. The \ninjection pipe should therefore  be lowered below the water level, to avoid this \n \nThe main advantages of this technique are as follows: - \n \n* It does not require acquisition of larg e piece of land like percolation tanks. \n \n* There  are  practically  no  losses  of  water  in   the   form   of   soil   moisture  and \nevaporation, which normally occur when the source water has to traverse the  \nvadose zone  \n  \n  \n \n \n* Disused or even o",
    "actically  no  losses  of  water  in   the   form   of   soil   moisture  and \nevaporation, which normally occur when the source water has to traverse the  \nvadose zone  \n  \n  \n \n \n* Disused or even operational dugwells can be  converted into recharge shafts, which  \ndoes not involve additional investment for recharge structure.  \n \n* Technology  and  design  of  the  recharge  shaft  is simple and can be applied even \n where baseflow is available for a limited period. \n \n* The  recharge  is  fast  and  immediately  delivers  the  benefit. In highly permeable \nformation, the recharge shaft are comp arable to percolation tanks with no \nsubmergence and hence no land compensation to local farmers. \n \n The recharge shafts can be constructed in  two different ways viz. Vertical and \nlateral. The details of each is given in the following paragraphs. \n \n \n3.1.8.1 Vertical Recharge Shaft - The vertical recharge shaft can be further improvised \nwith injection well at the bottom of the shaft. \n \n(a) Without Injection well   \n \n• Ideally suited for deep water levels (up to 15 metres b.g.l.) \n• Presence of clay is encountered within 15 m.  \n• Effective in the areas of less vertical natural recharge  \n• Copious water available can be effectively recharged. \n• Effective with silt water also (using inverted filter consisting of layers \nof sand, gravel and boulder) \n• Depth and diameter depends upon the depth of aquifer and volume of \nwater to be recharged. \n• The rate of recharge depends on the a quifer material and silt content in \nthe water.  \n• The rate of recharge  with inverted filter ranges from 7 - 14 lps for 2 - 3 \nmeter diameter.  \n \n \nThis type of shaft has been constructed at the following places. \n \n• Brahm Sarovar, Kurukshetra district, Haryana - Silt free water \n• Dhuri drain, Sangrur district, Punjab - surface run off with heavy silt \n• Dhuri link drain, Sangrur district, Punjab - surface run off with heavy \nsilt \n• President Estate, New Delhi - Roof Top and Surface",

Artificial Recharge Through Injection Wells \n \n    Injection wells are structures similar to a tube well but with the purpose of \naugmenting the groundwater storage of a confin ed aquifer by pumping in treated surface \nwater under pressure (Figure 10). The injection wells are advantageous when land is scarce.  \n \n              This techniques was successf ully adopted at temple town of Bhadrachallam in \nA.P. during 1987 to provide safe drinking water to about 2 to 3 lakh pilgrims on the festival \nof Shriramanawami.  The ground water aqui fer had meager reserve and had to be \nnecessarily replenished through induced recharge  from Godavari River.

    "e \nnecessarily replenished through induced recharge  from Godavari River.  The surface water \ncould not be directly pumped to the distributi on system due to turbidity and bacteriological \ncontaminations.  A water supply scheme was successfully executed by construction of 30 \nfilter point wells of 90 cm dia which yielded about 60 cubic metre/ha of potable water, \nmainly the induced recharge from river with phreatic alluvial aqui fer acting as filtering \nmedium. Hydraulically the effectiveness of  induction of water in injection well is \ndetermined by: - \n \n(a) Pumping Rate \n(b) Permeability of aquifer \n(c) Distance from stream \n(d) Natural ground water gradient \n(e) Type of well \n \n            In alluvial areas injection well recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can \nbe constructed to normal gravel packed pum ping well. An injection pipe with opening \nagainst the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient.  However, in case of number of \npermeable zones separated by impervious rock s, a properly designed injection well with \ninlet pipe against each aquifer to be recharge d need to be constructed. The injection wells \n  \n  \n \nas a means of artificial recharge are comp aratively costlier and require specialised \ntechniques of tubewell constructed supported by operation and maintenance to protect the \nrecharge well from clogging. \n \n \n3.1.10 Induced Recharge: \n \n            It is an indirect method of artificial  recharge involving pumping from aquifer \nhydraulically connected with surface water, to induce recharge to the ground water \nreservoir.  When the cone of depression intercepts river recharge boundary a hydraulic \nconnection gets established with surface source which starts providing part of the pumpage \nyield.  In such methods there is actually no artificial build  up of ground water storage but \nonly passage of surface water to the pump through an aquifer.   In this sense, it is more a \npumpage augmentation rather than artificial recharge measure.",
    "icial build  up of ground water storage but \nonly passage of surface water to the pump through an aquifer.   In this sense, it is more a \npumpage augmentation rather than artificial recharge measure.  (Fig. 11). \n \n           In hardrock areas the aband oned channels often provide good sites for induced \nrecharge.  Check weir in stream channel, at  location up stream of the channel bifurcation, \ncan help in high infiltration from surface reservoir to the abandoned channel when heavy \npumping is carried out in wells located in the burried channel. \n \n           The greatest advantage of th is method is that under  favourable hydrogeological \nsituations the quality of su rface water generally improves due to its path through the \naquifer material before it is discharged from the pumping well.   \n  \n            For obtaining very large water supplies from river bed la ke bed deposits or water-\nlogged areas, collector wells are constructed.  In India such wells have been installed in \nYamuna Bed at Delhi and other places in Gu jarat, Tamil Nadu and Orissa.  The large \ndischarges and lower lift heads make these wells  economical even if initial capital cost is \nhigher as compared to tube well. \n \n           In areas where the phreatic aqui fer adjacent to the river is of limited thickness, \nhorizontal wells may be more appropriate th an vertical wells.  Collector well with \nhorizontal laterals and infiltra tion galleries can get more induced recharge from the stream \ncollector wells constructed in seasonal nala beds these can be effective as induced recharge \nstructures for short periods only. \n          \nSite Characteristics and Design Guidelines:     1. A collector well is a large diameter (4 \nto 8 m) well from which laterals are driven/d rilled near the bottom at one or two levels \ninto permeable strata.  The central well is a vertical concrete cassion in precast rings, (wall \nthickness 0.45 m) sunk upto the bottom of aqui fer horizon.  The bo ttom of cassion is \nseal",
    "wo levels \ninto permeable strata.  The central well is a vertical concrete cassion in precast rings, (wall \nthickness 0.45 m) sunk upto the bottom of aqui fer horizon.  The bo ttom of cassion is \nsealed by thick concrete plugs.  Slotted stee l pipes, 9 mm thick, 15 to 50 cm in diameter \nhaving open area above 15% and a tapered leading are driven  laterally through port holes \nat appropriate places in the cassion.  The successive slotted pipes are welded and driven \nusing special hydraulic jacks installed at the bottom of the cassion.  The number of laterals \nis usually less than 16 thus permitting minimu m angle of 22 30”, between two laterals.  \nThe maximum length of lateral reported is 132 m. and the total length of laterals from 120 \n  \n  \n \nto 900 m. depending upon requirement of yield. \n \n2. The laterals are developed by flushing and if  entrance velocity of water is kept less \nthan 6-9 mm/sec, these do not get filled by sand.  The effective radius of a collector well is \n75 to 85% of the individual lateral length. \n \n \n3.1.11 Ground Water Dams Or Sub-Surface Dykes Or Underground Bandharas  \n(UGB): \n \n            These are basically ground wa ter conservation structures and are effective to \nprovide sustainability to ground w ater stru ctures by arresting sub surface flow. A ground \nwater dam is a sub-surface ba rrier across stream which re tards the natural ground water \nflow of the system and stores water belo w ground surface to meet the demands during the \nperiod of need (Fig.12).  The main purpose of  ground water dam is to arrest the flow of \nground water out of the sub-basin and increase th e storage within the aquifer.  By dowing \nso the water levels in upstream part of ground water dam rises saturating the otherwise dry \npart of aquifer.   \n \n            The underground dam has following advantages: - \n \n*          Since the water is stored within the aquifer, submergence of land can be avoided  \nand land above reservoir can be utilised even after the",
    "he underground dam has following advantages: - \n \n*          Since the water is stored within the aquifer, submergence of land can be avoided  \nand land above reservoir can be utilised even after the construction of the dam. \n \n* No evaporation loss from the reservoir takes place. \n \n* No siltation in the reservoir takes place. \n \n* The potential disaster like collapse of dams can be avoided \n      \n            The aquifer to be replenished is generally one which is already over exploited by \ntube well pumpage and the declining trend of water levels in the aquifer has set in.  \nBecause of the confining layers of low pe rmeability the aquifer can not get natural \nreplenishment from the surface and needs di rect injection through recharge wells.  \nArtificial recharge of aquifers by injection well is also done in coastal regions to arrest the \ningress of sea water and to combat the problems of land subsidence in areas where \nconfined aquifers are heavily pumped. \n \n          In alluvial areas injection well recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can \nbe constructed in a fashion similar to nor mal gravel packed pumping well.  The only \ndifference is that cement sealing of the uppe r section of the well is done in order to \nprevent the injection pressures from forcing leakage of water through the annular space of \nbore hole and well assembly.  In  hard rock areas casing a nd well screens may not be \nrequired.  An injection pipe with opening against the aquife r to be recharged may be \nsufficient.  However, in case of number of permeable horizons separated by impervious \nrocks like vesicular basalts or cavernous limes tones, a properly designed injection well \nmay be constructed with slotte d pipe against the aquifer to be recharged.  In practice the \n  \n  \n \ninjection rates are limited by the physical characteri stics of the aquifer.

    "ion rates are limited by the physical characteri stics of the aquifer.  In the vicinity of \nwell, the speed of groundwater flow may increa se to the point that the aquifer is eroded, \nspecially if it is made up of unconsolidated or semi-consolidated rocks.  In confined \naquifer confining layers may fail if too great pressure is created under them.  If this \noccurs, the aquifer will become clogged in the vicinity of the borehole and/or may \ncollapse. \n \n \n3.1.12 Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting  \n \nIn Urban areas, the roof top rainwater can be conserved and used for recharge of \nground water. This approach requires connecting the outlet pipe from rooftop to divert the \nwater to either existing wells/ tubewells/borewell or specially designed wells. The urban \nhousing complexes or institutional buildings have large roof area and can be utilising for \nharvesting roof top rainwater to recharge a quifer in urban areas (Fig 12A).

The monitoring data speaks for the \nefficacy of structures constructed for artific ial recharge and greatly helps in taking \neffective measures for Ground Water Management on scientific lines. \n \n \n4.1 Water Level Monitoring \n \n               During the feasibility study stage the monitoring of surface water and ground \nwater levels greatly help in identifying the method of artificial rech arge.  Net work of \nobservation wells is used to study the ground wa ter flow pattern and temporal changes in \npotentiometric head in the aquifer. \n \n              The observation well net work  during feasibility stage is generally of low well \ndensity but spread over a large area with  the primary aim of defining the boundary \nzonation of the aquifer to be recharged and to know the hydraulic characteristics of the \nnatural ground water system.  After identification of the feasible groundwater structure the \nobservation well net work is redefined in a sm aller area with greater well density.  The \nobjective of monitoring system is to study the e ffect of artificial recharge on the natural \nground water system.  Depending on the me thod of artificial recharge and the \nhydrogeology of the area, the observation well net work has to  be designed.

    "ial recharge and the \nhydrogeology of the area, the observation well net work has to  be designed.  The \nmonitoring system of observa tion well network should be desi gned specially to monitor \nimpact of individual structures which can furt her be extended to monitor the impact of \ngroup of such structures in the artificial recharge scheme area.  The net work should \ncontain observation wells (1) near the center of the recharge facility (2) a sufficient \ndistance from the recharge facility to observe  composite effects and (3) near the limit of \nhydrological boundaries.  If the recharged aqui fer is overlain by confining/semi-confining \nlayer, piezometers should be installed to monitor the wate r levels of overlying and \nunderlying aquifers which helps in the study of leakages etc. \n \n               Where the surface water bodies are hydraulically connected with the ground \nwater aquifer which is being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles \nof both Surface water and Ground water.  \n \n               The periodic monitoring of Water Levels can demarcate the zone of benefit.  In \nthis method a network of observation wells is established in the area likely to be benefitted \nand following observations are made: - \n \n1. In the zone benefitted, the water leve ls be observed to the whether the well \nhydrographs have a flat apex during the time when  there is water in the recharge structure \n(tank, pit etc.). \n \n2.          Wells situated outside the zone of influence nor mally show an angular apex for \n  \n  \n \nthe period when the recharge is  taking place, while these situated within the zone of \ninfluence have a flatter area. \n \n3. The recession limbs of wells close to a recharge structure normally have a gentle \ngradient as compared to those located far off. \n \n4. Crops in the zone of influence will be healthy compared to those outside such an \narea.  Further more, in the zone of influen ce there is a tendency to  grow crops with high \nwater requi",
    "ar off. \n \n4. Crops in the zone of influence will be healthy compared to those outside such an \narea.  Further more, in the zone of influen ce there is a tendency to  grow crops with high \nwater requirements. \n \n5. Well yields in the zone of influence shoul d be greater than those outside it.  The \nwells in benefitted zones may have more sustainability in lean period than those outside. \n \n                The above criteria can be used to define the zone of influence and thereby, a real \nand temporal demarcation of the effectivene ss of recharge structures.  This methodology \nwas adopted in Maharashtra, India (Fig.13). \n \n \n4.2 Tracer Technique For Demarcating Zone Of Benefit \n \n            The tracers are useful in demarcating the area benefitted by artificial recharge, \nTritium; Rodhomine B, fluorescent dye and environmental isotopes etc. are quite useful in \nassessing the extent of recharge and efficiency of recharge structures. \n \n \n4.3 Water Quality Monitoring \n \n               The monitoring of water quality during the implementation of artificial recharge \nschemes is essential to maintain the quality standards for specified uses of the augmented \nresource.  In case of injection wells the com position of native water in the aquifer and the \nrecharged water is important to prevent cl ogging of well and aquife r due to excessive \nprecipitation of salts.  The data on the chemi cal quality of native water and the changes \nwhich take place during the artificial rechar ge schemes should be collected by regular \nsampling from observation well net work.  Where treated wastewater is used for recharge \na careful monitoring is required to detect a nd preclude any possibility of contamination \nthrough a network of monitoring wells.  Thus , the type of water quality monitoring \nprogramme depends on the spec ific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water \nquality, effect of soil salina tion, and prevention of any contam ination etc.  The samples to \nbe collected wi",
    "programme depends on the spec ific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water \nquality, effect of soil salina tion, and prevention of any contam ination etc.  The samples to \nbe collected will also depend on the purpose and are generally categorised into (1) \nIndicative (2) Basic and (3) Comprehensive.  The indicative samples are collected at 1 to 4 \nmonths intervals and used to ascertain the presence of injected effluent.  Basic samples are \ntaken at monthly intervals for wells already influenced by recharge to determine the effect \nof recharge effluent on ground water quality and the purification provided by flow through \nthe soil and aquifer system.  Comprehensive samp les are taken at interv als of 6 months to \n1 year for observation wells and production wells  to determine water quality with respect \nto specific standards for intended water use.  \n  \n  \n \n4.4  IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \n The impact assessment of Artificial Recharge schemes can generally be \nenumerated as follows: - \n \na) Conservation and harvesting of surplus monsoon runoff in ground water reservoir \nwhich otherwise was going un-utilised outside the watershed/ basin and to sea. \nb) Rise in ground water levels due to add itional recharge to ground water.  In case \nwhere continuous decline of ground water le vel was taking place , a check to this \nand/or the intensity of decline subseque ntly reduces. The energy consumption for \nlifting the water also reduces. \nc) The ground water structures in the benefitt ed zone of artificia l structures gains \nsustainability and the wells provides wate r in lean month when these were going \ndry.  The domestic wells will become su stainable and many of the areas become \ntanker free. \nd) The cropping pattern in the benefitted z one will undergo marked change due to \nadditionality of ground water and cash cr ops will start growing.

Orchards which \nwent dry earlier due to ground water scarcity may rehabilitated and new plantation \nbe grown. \ne) Green vegetation cover may increase in th e zone of benefit and also along the \nstructures due to additional availability of soil moisture. \nf) The quality of ground water may improve due to dilution. \ng) Besides the direct measurable impacts, the artificial recharge schemes will \ngenerate indirect benefit in terms of d ecease in soil erosion, improvement in fauna \nand flora, influx of migratory birds, etc.  Besides, the social and economic status of \nfarmers of benefitted zone will also substantially improve due to increase in crop \nproduction. \n \n \nRemarks: - \n \nFormat for preparation of Artif icial Recharge Project and Ch ecklist for planning is given \nin Annexure I and Annexure II\n.

    "is watershed have resulted \nin increased lifting costs for ground water withdr awal, deepening of wells, construction of \ndeep bore wells and in many cases reduction in areas as well as production of orange \ncrops.  The multidisciplinary approach a dopted by Central Ground Water Board to \naugment sub-surface storage included topogr aphical studies to assess and understand \nvarious physiographic parameters important to locate the appropriate recharge structures, \nHydrometeorological studies to assess the rainfall pattern for working out design of \nrecharge structures, hydrological studies to assess non committed surplus monsoon run off \navailable for recharge and hydr ogeological studies to assess the capability of basaltic \naquifers to accommodate the additional recharge for utilisation in lean period.  The studies \nhave brought out that the watershed cove ring 488 sq.km. area has surplus monsoon runoff \nof about 98.9 Million Cubic Metres (MCM ) which can be conserved through simple \nartificial recharge structures  like percolation tanks and check dams (cement plugs).  The \nefficiency of these structures constructed at suitable locations with  appropriate design in \ncase of percolation tanks is 91% and for cement plugs 94%. \n \n \n The total capacity utilisation of percolat ion tank has been found to be upto 150% \ndue to repetitive fittings and up to 400% in case of cement plugs.   The benefitted area in \ncase of percolation tanks with gross storag e capacity varying from 71 to 220 Thousand \nCubic Metres (TCM) varied from 60 to 120 hectares (ha) during 1997-98 and benefits \nextended upto 1.5 km. down stream of percola tion tanks.  In case of cement plugs with \nstorage capacity varying from 2.10 TCM to 7.42 TCM varied from 3 to 15 ha during \n1997-98.

    "s in the command ar eas of these structures were benefited \nnot only in terms of rise in ground water le vels compared to pre-project period but the \nsustainability of ground water pumpage increased during summer period.  The  Figures 14 \nand 15 indicate the improvement in ground water levels in the command areas of \npercolation tank and Check dam. Additional areas were brought und er cultivation and \nareas of orange orchards have increased.  The project implemented by CGWB has proved \nthe techno-economic feasibility of the artificial recharge techniques in basaltic terrain with \nno adverse environmental impact. \n \n \n5.1.1 Technical Evaluation Studies in Jeur Sub-basin Ahmednagar District,      \n         Maharashtra: \n \nCentral Ground Water Board in collaboration with Directorate of Irrigation \nResearch and Development, Government of Maharashtra has studied the efficiency of \nexisting percolation tanks in sustaining the yield of dug wells used  for agriculture. The \nevaluation of 12 existing percolation tanks in Jeur Sub-basin, Ahmednagar district, during \n1989 brought the following. \n \n• The recharge to ground water or effectivene ss of percolation tanks varies from 36 to \n76.7% with an average of 49.6%. The locatio n of PT in suitabl e sites and proper \ndesign plays an important role in effectiveness and efficiency of percolation tanks. \n  \n  \n \n• In some of the percolation tanks, visible s eepage varies from 20 to 53% of the volume \nharvested.  This is mainly due to faulty designs. \n \n• The percolation tanks located over vesi cular and fractured basalts have better \nefficiency. \n \n• The evaporation losses are generally within 15% of the total storage. \n \n \n5.2     Mountain Front Recharge Augmen tation For Alluvial  Aquifers - \nMaharashtra: \n \nThe prominent regional aquifer system for Tapi Alluvial basin paralleling Satpura \nMountain front is being extens ively developed to meet th e water requirement of cash \ncrops like Banana and Sugarcane.

    "quifer system for Tapi Alluvial basin paralleling Satpura \nMountain front is being extens ively developed to meet th e water requirement of cash \ncrops like Banana and Sugarcane.  This has le d to decline of water levels of more than 8-\n10 metres during last 10-15 years.  Large num ber of wells has either gone dry or their \nyields have declined.  There is thus an urge nt need to augment the ground water resources \nof the Tapi alluvial basin.  The Satpura Mountain front offers favourable locale to \naugment ground water reservoir due to the hi gh infiltration capacity of alluvial fans \noccurring in this zone.  The Central Ground  Water Board has undertaken artificial \nrecharge studies in one of the watersheds TE-17 in Jalgaon distri ct wherein extensive \nground water irrigation for Banana crop ha s resulted in depletion of ground water \nresource.  The studies unde rtaken included assessmen t of surplus monsoon runoff \navailable in the watershed and delineation of potential talus and scree zone locally known \nas Bazada which offers favourable location for construction of artificial recharge \nstructures.  The studies included assessment of  the total thickness of unsaturated granular \nzone above water table to determine the potential of recharge in this zone.  The sub \nsurface storage potential of watershed 5 metr es below ground level was assessed as 85 \nMillion Cubic Metres (MCM ) compared to surplus monsoon runoff of 29.7 MCM.  \nArtificial recharge techniques like recharge through percola tion tanks, recharge through \nexisting dug wells, recharge sh afts and through injection tu bewells were experimented.  \nSome of the existing artificial recharge struct ures like village tanks were renovated to \nconvert these into percolation tanks and storage capacity of existing percolation tanks was \naugmented by stream diversion from adjacent watershed.

    "lation tanks was \naugmented by stream diversion from adjacent watershed.  The percolation tanks in Bazada \nformation of Satpura foothills we re found to be highly efficient with efficiency as high as \n97% and capacity utilisation going upto 400%.  The zone of benefit extended to 5 km with \nbenefited area up to 400 ha.  The recharge through existing disused dug wells utilising \nsurplus water from existing canal irrigation sy stem provided encouraging results and after \nobserving this experiment, the local farmers have resorted to dug well recharge through \ntheir own efforts providing sustainability to ground water development.  Recharge through \ninjection tubewell though feasible is not very  effective and efficien t compared to other \nartificial recharge techniques.  The studi es undertaken by Central Ground Water Board \nhave clearly indicated that the Satpur a Mountain front is quite favourable for \nimplementation of a mega artificial recharge  project which can ut ilize the techniques \nexperimented in watershed TE-17 for augmen ting the depleting ground water resources of \nTapi Alluvial Tract (Fig. 16). \n  \n  \n \nCOST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ART IFICIAL RECHARGE STRUCTURES \nCONSTRUCTED UNDER THE PROJECT IN WATERSHED WR-2, DISTRICT \nAMRAVATI \n \n \nSl. \nNo. \nType of \nStructure \nAdditional \nRecharge \nto ground \nwater due \nto \nstructure \n(TCM) \nAddi-\ntional  \narea \nbrou-\nght \nunder \nirrigat-\nion (ha) \nIncre-\nmental \nincome \ndue  \n  to \nassured \nirrigat-\nion \n(Rs/ha/ \nyr) \nTotal \nincremen\n-tal    \nincome  \ndue  \naddition-\nal \nirrigation \nby \nstructure \n(Rs/yr) \nConstru-\nctional \ncost \nground \nwater of \nstructure \n(Rs.) \nLife \nof \nstruc\nture \n(yrs) \nAnnual \ninvest-\nment for \nconstr-\nction \n(Rs.) \nIncre-\nmental \non \nannual \nExpe-\nnditure \n@ \n10% \n(Rs.) \nTotal \nannual \ninves-\ntment \n(Rs.) \nCost \nbenefit \nratio \n(A)      PERCOLATION TANK \n1 Benoda    131.6  26.32 10,000 2,63,200 29,216,00   25 1,16,864 11,686 1,28,5\n50 \n1:2.00 \n2 Manikpu\nr \n   117.8  23.56 10,000 2,35,600 30,63,",

The \nexperiment involved transferri ng of water from shallow aquifer to the deeper confined \naquifer using siphon principle.  In this expe riment, a shallow tube well (dia : 350 mm) of \n21.34 m depth was drilled in west bank of Sa barmati river bed and tapping the shallow \nphreatic aquifer between 6.04 and 21.34 m below river bed level.  An injection well \n(diameter of 600 mm up to 75 m from ground level and followed by 400 mm to the depth \nof 240 m) to a depth of 238 m was drilled a nd developed at a distance of 61.3 m from the \nsource well on the same bank of the river.  An  observation well to the same depth of 238 \nm was drilled near the inj ection well to monitor the re sponse of the aquifer during \nartificial recharge.  These deep wells tap the confined aquifers below 74 m depth which \nare under heavy exploitation for agricultural activities.  A sc hematic diagram showing the \narrangement of source well, injection well, connecting si phon pipe and the observation \nwell is shown in Fig. 17).  \n \n          A trial recharge experiment  was conducted for 92 days for understanding the \nresponse of the aquifer during th e recharge in terms of devel opment of recharge cone and \ndissipation of recharge mound.  A stabilised recharge rate of 590 litres per minute (LPM) \nwas observed from 200\nth minute of the recharge experiment till the end.

The source of water drawn for the artifici al recharge through pressure injection test \nwas from the phreatic aquifer below the Sarswa ti river bed.  Since ground water was used \nfor artificial recharge, the injection water was devoid of silts and other impurities and \nchemically compatible with the water in a quifer getting recharged.  The experimental \nresults did not show any advers e effect of clogging.  The pr essure injection experiment \nwas conducted continuously for about 250 days with an average inje ction quantity of 225 \ncubic meters per day.  During the recharge cycle,  a rise in water level of 5 meters in the \ninjection well (apparent built up of 11 m) and 0.6 to 1.0 m in  wells 150 meters away from \nthe injection well were observed.

    "ction well (apparent built up of 11 m) and 0.6 to 1.0 m in  wells 150 meters away from \nthe injection well were observed.  The higher rate of injection continuously for about 250 \ndays was probably sustained because of cont emporaneous withdrawal from the aquifer \nthrough nearby irrigation wells. (Fig. 18). \n \n          In Mehsana area, artificial recharge experiments through spreading method were \nalso conducted using canal water.  A spread ing channel of 3.3 meters width, 400 m length \nwith 1 in 1 side slope was c onstructed and in which the cana l water was fed for 46 days.  \nThe recorded build up in water level of 1.4 to 2 m. was observed up to 15 m from the \nrecharge channel and about 20 cm at distance of 200 m.  The recharge rate of 260 cubic \nmeters per day was estimated using an infi ltration rate of 17 cm /day.  Dissipation in \nrecharge mound (1.42 m) was observed in 15 days. \n \n           Another experiment using a r echarge pit (1.7 m x 1.7 m x 0.75 m) to study the \nfeasibility of recharging the shallow aquifers was conduc ted at Dabhu in Central Mehsana \narea.  Canal water was used for the experime nt and the pit was covered to prevent dust \ndeposition and evaporation losses.  During th e recharge phase of 60 days, the recharge \nwas effected at the rate of 17.3 cubic meters per day with an  infiltration of 0.5 m/day.  A \nrise of 4.13 m in water level was observed at a distance of 5 meters from  the recharge pit.  \nBoth these recharge methods were effective in alluvial areas. \n \n           Artificial recharge through pre ssure injection technique was tried on a pilot scale \nusing ground water from phreatic aquifer fo r a short period in the Mehsana alluvial \naquifers.  The source well was located in the Saraswati River and the water was carried to \ninjection well at distance of 130 meters by 10 cm pipeline.  On-line flow meter and \npressure gauge were fitted to monitor the flow rate and cumulative quantity and to record \nthe pressure developed during inje",
    "well at distance of 130 meters by 10 cm pipeline.  On-line flow meter and \npressure gauge were fitted to monitor the flow rate and cumulative quantity and to record \nthe pressure developed during injection experiment.  The in jection recharge experiment \nwas conducted with 8 litres per second (LPS) ra te for about an hour.  The injection rate \nwas increased to 12 LPS and the test was continued for 90 minutes.  A drastic reduction in \n  \n  \n \nrecharge rate (3 LPS) was reported and the cause of reduction was attributed to \nbackpressure due to clogging of injection we ll.  Due to well clogging, the water level \ncould not reach to its initial st atic level even after 8 days.  Though, in this case, the silt-\nfree shallow ground water was used for recharge , the observational results clearly indicate \nthe necessity of understanding probable cl ogging problems which may arise due many \nother factors apart from silt entry. \n \n          Studies on control of salinity in the coastal Saurashtra using spreading and injection \nmethod have indicated that the recharge pit and the injection shaft can effect recharge at \nthe rate of 192 and 2600 cubic meters per da y respectively.  Canal water was used for \nrecharge studies. Problems in land acquisition in this highly developed area make it \ndifficult to select suitable sites for spreading structures. \n \n          A short period pressure inject ion was conducted by the Gujarat Water Resources \nDevelopment Corporation in 1974 near Ahmedaba d city.  Processed water from the city \nwater works was injected for 72 hours in a deep  tube well and a pre ssure varying between \n80-100 PSI with a rate of 45 litres per second. \n \n \n5.5 Artificial Recharge Studies In The Ghaggar River Basin  - Haryana: \n \nCentral Ground Water Board, with the assist ance of UNDP, has undertaken artificial \nrecharge studies involving indu ced recharge and recharge th rough injection wells at two \nsites located in the districts Ambala an d Kurukshetra along with Gh",
    "ance of UNDP, has undertaken artificial \nrecharge studies involving indu ced recharge and recharge th rough injection wells at two \nsites located in the districts Ambala an d Kurukshetra along with Ghaggar river in \nHaryana.  The Dabkheri site in the Narwana Branch area, Kurukshetra district was \nselected for the artificial recharge studies  by the injection well method after detailed \nhydrogeological surveys.  An in jection well tapping aquifer at  different depth levels was \ndeveloped with cement sealing from ground le vel to a depth of 15 m.  The injection \nexperiment was carried out using canal wate r with an injection rate of 43.3 LPS under \npressure.  It was observed that  the injection pre ssure of 1.6 atmosphe re raised to 1.96 \natmosphere within 30 minutes  of injection and remained constant for about 4 hours.  \nSudden and violent vibrations in the injection line were reported to have been witnessed \nand the injection pressure shot  up to 2.5 atmosphere and it wa s reported that it was due to \nclogging of foot valve with grass etc. \n \n            After construction and deve lopment of another injection well with improved \ndesign, second injection recharge experiment was conducted with a re charge rate of 40 \nLPS for 389 hours and with 22 LPS for another 24 hours.  The experiment demonstrated \nthat the hydrogeological condi tions of the area are favourab le for artificial recharge \nthrough injection method.

The third scheme of construc tion of percolation tanks and check dam is \nfeasible for the peripheral and outskirts regi on which are rural areas with plenty of open \nspace available. \n \n5.8.1  Roof top rainwater harvesting for ground water recharge \n \nIn Nagpur city roof top rain water expe riment was done in Ujjwal Nagar area \nwhere the roof top rain water collected from the concrete roof of 100 m3 was diverted into \nthe existing water supply dug well of the house hold. About 80,000 litres was recharged \nduring the monsoon. \n \n5.8.2 Run off rain water harvesting for ground water recharge in city area \n \n            The rainfall runoff flowing from the road s and open grounds is substantial during \nthe monsoon.

During 1998,2427 Cubic Metres of rainwater was harvested and \nrecharged to ground water through propose built injection tubewells (Fig. 21). \n \n            The additional recharge to  ground water has resulted in  sustainable yield of \ntubewells already being operated. It is estimat ed that for effective impact roof area of \nabout 1000 sq.m. is required to harvest rain  water. However, this should be done by \nindividual house/flat owner and if done colle ctively the impact will be very significant. \n  \n  \n \nThe studies have shown that the ground water quality has improved \n          \n   \n5.10 Artificial Recharge To Ground Water In N.C.T.

Indisc riminate extraction in Minjur - a coastal area \nalong the North Sea coast of Chennai, has been  spoiled because of over exploitation. The \nMetrowater is now taking up serious effort s to disseminate Rain Water Harvesting \ntechniques to the citizens of Chennai. In th e process, it has issued notifications to the \nbuilders who are constructing complexes with  1+3 floors to implement the Rain Water \nHarvesting measures. Chennai City receive s rainfall ranging from 1100 to 1200 per \nannum. As per statistics, a house on one ground plot (223 sq.m.) gets about 700 litres of \nwater a day by rainfall. Even in the case of multi-storied flats, where the effective space of \nper resident may be as small as 50 sq.m. , the rainfall corresponds to an amount of about \n100 to 150 litres per day.

The \nhuge withdrawal of ground wate r has led to decline in the water levels. The ground water \ndevelopment has already reached to 118% during 1998. To augument ground water \nrecharge to restrict further decline of wate r levels one cement plug at Jhawal (Afzalpur), \ntwo check dams at Roopwali and Khera v illages, 19 Gabbion structures. Total water \navailable for recharge is 10.90 mcm. \n \n5.33  Artificial recharge to Water She d TE-11, Jalgaon District, Maharashtra \n \nIn the TE-11 watershed water levels are steadily declining at the rate of 1 metre per \nyear. The depth to water levels  ranges between 30-40 mbgl. In  order to tap the rainwater \ngoing waste as runoff two percolation tanks and five recharge shafts are being constructed \n(Fig-31). It is estimated that 14.51 mcm water is available as surplus run-off. Sub-surface \nstorage potential available is 153 mcm. Aver age thickness of aquifer that has become \ndesaturated is about 12.00 m. Volume of  sub-surface aquifer in which recharge can take \nplace is 3827 mcm. \n \n \n5.34  Artificial recharge in Chogwan Area, Baghpat District, Uttar Pradesh \n \n          The Chogwan area lies between Krishni and Hindon rivers covering parts of Binauli \nblock, Baghpat district, Uttar Pradesh.

    "e in Chogwan Area, Baghpat District, Uttar Pradesh \n \n          The Chogwan area lies between Krishni and Hindon rivers covering parts of Binauli \nblock, Baghpat district, Uttar Pradesh. In this area irrigation is from ground water sources. \nThe over-dependence of ground water has caused d ecline of water levels in the range of 3 \n– 5 m over last one decade. The area has number of village ponds which have enough \nwater even during summer season. During ra iny season, the water over flows through \nthese tanks. At Garhi Kangran, this excess water is being used for Artificial recharge \nthrough lateral shafts wi th three injection wells  (Fig.- 32). It is estimated that 4000 cum \nwater is being recharged annually. \n \n \n  \n  \n \n5.35    Artificial recharge to ground wat er in Jammna, District Hoogli, West Bengal \n \nThe stage of ground water development (85 %) in Hoogli district is very high. In \nPandua block the river Dhusi is one such st ream which is connected with river Gangur \nthrough a 5 km long channel. Almost entire stretch of the channel has been silted  \nparticularly there is no flow  except during peak monsoon. Aver age depth to water level is \n16 m.bgl. It is proposed to de-silt the channel to augment ground water recharge.  \n \n \n5.36 Artificial recharge to ground water in Khatura Bangar, North 24 Parganas, \nWest Bengal  \n \nThe status of development of the ground water (80%) in the district of North 24 \nparganas is quite high. The district has consid erable area of water bodies like tanks, beels, \nrivers, bangar etc. Most of these water bodies have been silted up. Due to which the \nreservoir capacity has decreased and rechar ge through the water bodies have been \nminimised. It is proposed to enhance the rech arge rate by de-silting these water bodies. \nThis will result in rise in the water levels in the area.  \n \n \n5.37 Artificial recharge to ground water in District Purulia, West Bengal \n \nIn Purulia district cropping intensity is very high (116%).

The Irrigation is from \nsurface and ground water resource s. Principal rock types ar e Archean gneiss having 15 – \n20 m weathered mantle. Depth to water leve l varies from 4.00 to 11.00 m bgl. The water \nlevel fluctuation vary from 1 to 5 m. The ar ea has moderate to high slopes and bulk of \nrainfall is lost due to high run- off. Different types of artificia l recharge structures such as \nsub-surface dykes, Nalla bunds, tank excavation, re-excavation of existing minor irrigation \ntanks and contour bunding are being construc ted. The implementation of these schemes \nwill store the excess monsoon run off on the surface which other than supplying water for \nirrigation will also recharge the shallow unc onfined aquifer to create additional sub-\nsurface storage for further utilisation.  \n \n \n5.38  Artificial recharge to ground wa ter in Mainpura, District Jhunjhunu, \nRajasthan \n \nDue to excessive withdrawal of ground wa ter for industrial & irrigation purposes, \nthe area has experienced sharp decline in water level to the tune of 7.1 m in last 13 years \nand average decline in ground water level is 0.54 m /year. The stage of ground water \ndevelopment is 118.76 % in alluvium & 180.43 % in quartzite. The catchment of Kantli \nriver is 4667.8 Sq. Km and runoff availability is  93 MCM. For utilising the some part of \nthe available runoff for augmentation of ground water resources, one sub surface barrier  \nof 0.8 m. height, 2.75 m depth & 89 m long and th ree gravity head inverted wells of 1.2 m \ndia & 10 m. depth are being constructed \n \n  \n  \n \n5.39  Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting In C.G.W.B.

    "Office Premises, Jaipur \n \nDue to over development of ground water for domestic water supply in Jaipur the \nground water levels are continuously declining. Therefore for utilisi ng the roof top rain \nwater for recharge to ground water, the CGWB Office building at Jhalana Dungri at Jaipur \nis identified for experimental study. The roof top / paved area of the building is 1250 Sq. \nm.  The depth to ground water level is 29.0 m.bgl. The rate of decline is 1.10 m / year. The \nannual availability of water from roof top / paved area is 544 Cum.  For recharging the \navailable runoff an injection tubewell of 250 mm dia. and 50 m depth is being constructed \n(Fig- 33).  \n \n \n5.40  Artificial Recharge To Ground Wa ter Through Sub-Surface Dyke At Nallan \nPillai Patral, Gingee Block, Gingee Taluk, Villupuram District, Tamil Nadu \n \nThe project is located in a backward area having concen tration of landless labour. \nVillupuram district is severely affected by drought every year. Due to nature of the terrain \nand gradient of land, depletion of storage of water occurs at a very rapid rate and the entire \nzone becomes dry during summer. It is propos ed to tap ground water by constructing sub-\nsurface dyke. The length of dyke is expected to be about 100 m whereas depth is around \n3.50 – 7.00 m. The construction of dyke will result in better availability of water in the \ndug wells for a longer period even during summer months.  \n \n \n5.41  Artificial Recharge To Ground Water Through Sub-Surface Dyke, \nChirayinkil Block , Trivandrum District, Kerala \n \nThe area is located in Vamanpuram basi n, which is drained by a small nala in \nwhich base flow is availabl e upto mid-February only. Due to  drying up of the Nala the \narea faces acute water shortages during peak summer seasons. The average rainfall is 1963 \nmm of which about 70% is r eceived during south-western monsoon.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe increasing demand for water in the country has brought forward the realisation \nthat the underground reservoirs formed by the aquifers constitute invaluable water supply \nsources as well as natural water storage faci lities.  The planned augmentation of water \nstorage in the ground water reservoirs by suita ble recharge techniques is useful for \nreducing over-draft, conserving surface r unoff and increasing available ground water \nsupplies. Recharge may be incidental, when it is a by product of normal land and water \nutilisation measures and planned when the work  is carried out with the sole objective of \naugmenting ground water storage to improve wa ter availability or water quality, reduce \nimpact of floods or preventing/stopping sea water intrusion.  \n \nGround water recharge techni ques have been develope d world over through large \nnumber of experimental projects implemente d with diverse objectives.  Whereas the aim \nof majority of the projects was to augment ground water storage by utilizing surplus rainy \nseason flows or the waste waters; projects fo r beneficiation of wa ter quality, conserving \nsurface waters for subsequent use and stopping land subsidence were quite common.  In \nIndia, the applicability of technologies to tropical condi tions has been evaluated through a \nnumber of studies conducted by Central Gr ound Water Board and the State Ground Water \nOrganisations. \n \nThe experiences so gained form the base of this note to serve as guide for the \nevaluation of recharge schemes, now being conceived on a large scale in the States, before \ntheir sanction and implementation in order to derive the maximum returns on investments.  \nWhereas the main considerations will be the technical criteria, the expected financial",
    "in the States, before \ntheir sanction and implementation in order to derive the maximum returns on investments.  \nWhereas the main considerations will be the technical criteria, the expected financial \nbenefits can altogether not be lo st sight of.  It is, therefore, recommended that the rate at \n  \n  \n \nwhich the recharged water could be reclaime d must also be worked out for individual \nschemes. \n \nA well-planned recharge scheme will generally have three components. \n(i) Arrangement for source water. \n(ii) Well-designed structures to transfer the source water into the ground water \nreservoir. \n(iii) An Action Plan to use the stored ground water by suitable means. \n \nThe techno-economic viability of the project will thus depend on how best the cost \non each of the above components is kept at  minimum.  Whereas the detailed project \nplanning may have many permutations and comb inations with each option of the recharge \nscheme, the following may serve as a general guideline for planning: \n \n(i) Rock formation should be of moderate  permeability.  Low permeabilities reduce \nintake rate whereas high permeabilities do not allow retention of recharged water \nfor a longer time to make use of it during dry season. \n(ii) Basin development schemes, minor i rrigation tanks, afforestation, soil \nconservation schemes, are important sc hemes serving many other purposes in \naddition to augmenting recharge to the ground water reservoirs and hence are \npreferable. \n(iii) Injection wells or connector wells are costly schemes requiring high order of \nquality control and hence are not economically viable at this stage of time. \n(iv) Spreading methods have been found to be most economical structures. \n(v) Ground water dams are the most preferred c onservation measure as they need very \nlittle maintenance.  They are safe from natural catastrophe.  The evaporation losses \nare minimum and environmental problems arising out of stagnation are avoided. \n(vi) Availability of rainfall water fr",
    "tle maintenance.  They are safe from natural catastrophe.  The evaporation losses \nare minimum and environmental problems arising out of stagnation are avoided. \n(vi) Availability of rainfall water from the roof tops is so high that if properly used for \nartificial recharge (thr oughout the country) will not only increase ground water \navailability by will also help in reducing the problem of disposal of storm runoff in \ncities and towns. \n  \n  \n \n \n2. OBJECTIVES \n \nThe objectives of recharge schemes are generally the following: \n \n1. To augment the ground water resources. \n2. To store the surplus surface water particul arly during the flood periods for future \nuses and reduce the flood peaks. \n3. To retard the surface run off resulting in  lowering of flood peak, conserving the \nsoil by reducing soil erosion and improving the soil moisture retention for longer \nperiod to facilitate crop production and plant growth. \n4. To improve the quality of water stored.  When the source water passes through the \nsoil profile during the process of recharge, the soil mantle acts as membrane to the \ntravel of pathogen contained in the source water. \n5. To conserve the ground water at the point of use.  This is particularly suited to hard \nrock areas. \n6. To conserve thermal energy. \n7. To prevent saline intrusion in coastal aquifers. \n \n3. CONSIDERATIONS FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROJECTS \n(a) General Considerations: \n(i) Water availability. \n(ii) Favourable Topographic, Physiographic and Hydrogeologic set up. \n(iii) Infiltration and percolation characteristics of vadose zone. \n(iv) Hydrologic characteristics of the aqui fers such as capacity to store, \ntransmit and yield water. \n(v) Technical feasibility \n(vi) Economic viability. \n \n(b) General Recharge Methods \n(i) Water Spreading \n  \n  \n \n(ii) Water Injection (Recharge Wells) \n \n(iii) Induced Recharge \n(c) Characteristics of Basalts \nDark greenish-black, apparently homogeneous looking, basaltic rock of the \nDeccan occupies the",
    "(ii) Water Injection (Recharge Wells) \n \n(iii) Induced Recharge \n(c) Characteristics of Basalts \nDark greenish-black, apparently homogeneous looking, basaltic rock of the \nDeccan occupies the most extensive tract of  Western Peninsula covering large part \nof the States of Gujarat, Maharashtr a, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.  \nDeccan basalts popularly known as Deccan Trap consist of vast pile of lava flows \nlying over one another and include other volcanic products as tuffs, breccias, ash-\nbeds and sedimentary intertrappean deposits formed during the period between two \nlava flows.  The lava flow s have generally two distin ct horizons - Lower massive \nand Upper vesicular.  The massive part is  hard and compact whereas the vesicular \npart is characterised by vesi cles filled with secondary minerals (Amygdules).  The \nmassive traps are fractured and jointed at  places.  The weathering of massive and \nvesicular basalts form favourable loca les of surface and sub-surface water \ncirculation.  The cracks in the weathered z one are often filled with kankar.  An \ninteresting feature of the different basaltic lava flows is the contrast in their water \nbearing properties.  The massive basalts with their fracture porosities, the vesicular \nbasalts with their minutely interconnect ed and partly filled vesicles and \nintertrappean sediments with their primary porosities have all a decisive role to \nplay in determining the recharge capabili ties and suitable recharge structures of \ndifferent regions.  However, the recharge capacities of the rock types will be \ngreatly influenced by the overlying thickness,  texture and structure of the soils and \ntheir location with reference to topographic features. \n \nd) Recharge structures specific to Basaltic Terrain \n(i) Nala bunding \n(ii) Contour bunding \n(iii) Contour trenching \n(iv) Check dams \n(v) Pits and Shafts \n  \n  \n \n(vi) Percolation Tanks \n(vii) Surface channels/Trenches \n(viii) Groundwater dams \n \n4.

Hydrological Parameters: \n \n(a) Hydraulic conductivity of  the aquifer \nbeing recharged.  The objective of \nrecharging is to spread the water in \n  \n  \n \nthe larger reservoir than to form a \nmound at the point of recharge. \n \n(b) Specific yield/storativity of the \naquifer to be recharge. \n \n(c) Storage capacity of aquifer \nconsidering the space available above \nwater table and keeping in view \nrootzone of plants and crops to avoid \nwater logging. \n \n3. Ground water flow patter n; for ascertaining \nthe movement of recharged water to the point \nof use. \n \nFeatures of low permeability of Basalts, their multi - layer occurrence, fractured \nnature, presence of vesicular and amygdaloidal character besides attitude and the nature of \nrock formation need to be considered for formulating recharge scheme. \n \nBroad Features for consideration with  regard to Ground Water Hydrology in \nBasaltic Terrain \n \n The success of a recharge scheme will depend on a combination of various \nfavourable situations. However, the followi ng considerations could act as guiding \nprinciples. \n \nHydrogeologic Region Weathered, fractured and vesicular basalts will \nconstitute most favourabl e hydrogeologic set-ups.  \n(These needs to be identified and marked on maps). \n \nTopography of Water-shed Area Piedmont slopes constitute the best environs \nfollowed by valley floors.  Highly dissected slopes \nand plateau tops are less favourable.  \n \nWater level fluctuations Areas with high water level fluctuations, de",
    "lopes constitute the best environs \nfollowed by valley floors.  Highly dissected slopes \nand plateau tops are less favourable.  \n \nWater level fluctuations Areas with high water level fluctuations, deep water \ntable and steeper hydraulic gradient will induce high \nrecharge rates. \n \nHydraulic conductivity Weathered, jointed a nd vesicular basalts are \nexpected to have high hydraulic conductivity and \nwill constitute favourable environs in comparison \nwith massive basalts which are less susceptible to \nrecharge augmentation. \n \nThickness of soil cover and  Granular soil cover will have high infiltration rate in  \n  \n  \n \nInfiltration rate comparison to fine clay/matrix.  Black cotton soil \nderived from lava flow covering extensive  area is \nclayey and highly calcar eous and would impede \nrecharge. \n \nAquifer Type Phreatic aquifers will re ceive recharged water more \neasily than confined systems.  In the vesicular basalts \nand jointed basalts, the calcareous material filling the \nvesicles, cavities and joints can subsequently be \ndissolved by recharged water.  This tends to \naccelerate the recharge rate. \n \nHydraulic conductivity of Infiltration and percolation rate of unsaturated zone  \nUnsaturated rock in the zone  will contribute to accelerated recharge. \nof Aeration \n \nProfile of vertical recharge The unsaturated zone should as far as possible be  \nupto unsaturated zone. free from thick clay beds. \n \nRate of Recharge In favourable conditions  vesicular and fractured \nbasalt are expected to attain a recharge @ 10% - \n15%, whereas in non-favourable physiographic \nlocales underlain by massive basalt, the rate may be \nas low as 2 - 3%. \n \nQuantitative assessment Pre-Recharge Ground Water Balance of Aquifer  \nof ground water system. \n \n Post-Recharge Ground Water Balance of Aquifer \nsystem. \n \ng.

This paper deals with the various aspects of artificial recharge of groundwater \nincluding Managed Aquifer recharge (MAR) techniques and Remote Sensing (RIS) & \nGeographical Information Systems (GIS) Techniques  suitable for various hydrogeologic \nregions. Some issues and new perspectives in groundwater management is dealt with in detail \nhoping this work will be useful to all agencies engaged in planning and managem ent of \ngroundwater resources through artificial recharge techniques. \nINTRODUCTION \nEarth, as we know it, is a watery planet, with water covering roughly 71% of the total surface \narea. Total volume of water on earth is estimated to be about 1.386 billion km3. But not all of \nthis water is potable or suitable for industrial purposes. Of this huge volume of water, about \n97.5% is saline (1.351 billion km3) and the rest 2.5% is fresh water (35 million km3). But even \nall the fresh water is not available for use, as  most of this fresh water is locked up in the form \nof ice in glaciers and in the poles. Of all the fresh water, most of it, about 99% is groundwater, \nand less than even 1% is in the form of lakes, rivers and swaps which are readily available for \nhuman use.

    "nd less than even 1% is in the form of lakes, rivers and swaps which are readily available for \nhuman use. As evident from this data and the current human consumption of water, this tiny \n1% of fresh water is being exploited in all possible ways and would soon become too polluted \nto be usable. We also depend heavily on the rest 99 % that is the groundwater. But accessing \nthis groundwater is cost intensive.  \nGroundwater, unlike the surface fresh water, is not available readily at one particular depth. \nWe can dig only up to a limited depth to pump out this groundwater; hence, not all of it can be \naccessed. The accessible part of groundwater is being used by us extensively and this has led \nto the lowering of groundwater table , making it more and more difficult to access. Lowering \nof groundwater table is not the only effect of human use, there is also the more wor risome \nproblem of groundwater pollution and the degradation in its quality. Recharging of \ngroundwater takes place naturally via percolation and infiltration of rain water. But the recent \nclimate change effects on rainfall have rendered this natural method unpredictable. Therefore, \nthe need arises for artificial groundwater recharge. Artificial recharge to ground water is \ndefined as the recharge that occurs when the natural pattern of recharge is deliberately modified \nto increase recharge (ASCE, 2001). In broadest sense one can define artificial recharge as “any \nprocedure, which introduces water in a pervious stratum” (CGWB, 2007). Just the methods of \ngroundwater recharge are not the only concern of research; there are several perquisite \nconditions and other factors which are to be considered in order to ensure safe recharging and \nsustainable use of groundwater.  Some issues and new perspectives in groundwater \nmanagement have been dealt with in detail hoping th at they may help the agencies or persons \nengaged in planning and management of groundwater resources through artificial recharge \nte",
    "n groundwater \nmanagement have been dealt with in detail hoping th at they may help the agencies or persons \nengaged in planning and management of groundwater resources through artificial recharge \ntechniques. The relevant literature has compiled and studied to prepare this comprehensive \nreview article to make it as a ready reference for researchers, field engineers and the persons \nengaged in the works of artificial recharge of groundwater. Some past studies on artificial \nrecharge of groundwater from literature have been highlighted herein for their appropriateness.  \nMETHODS OF ARTIFICIAL GROUNDWATER RECHARGE \nListed below are the modern and conventional techniques of artificial groundwater recharge: \nManaged Aquifer Recharge (MAR) Techniques \nManaged Aquifer Recharge (MAR) can be used in conjunction with water harvesting \ntechniques to recharge an aquifer by catching water during rainfall, thus impeding the quick \nrunoff out of a catchment area (IGRAC, 2007).  The International Groundwater Resourc es \nAssessment Centre (IGRAC) is a non -commercial organization facilitating and promoting \nworld-wide exchange of groundwater knowledge related to MAR through their website \nwww.igrac.nl to improve assessment, development and management of groundwater resources. \nTo get an idea of what kind of recharge techniques are being used all over the globe, one may \nuse the MAR techniques that lists out the various groundwater recharge techniques undertaken \nin 50 different countries. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the application of \nMAR around the world.

Recharge can \nbe done by releasing water into  basins formed by excavation or by construction of dikes. \nPeriodic maintenance is required, which includes scarifying, disking or scraping the bottom of \nthe basin when dry. Multiple basins are preferred over a single basin, as they offer continuity \nof oper ation when certain basins are under maintenance, and also act as silting basins for \nsystems where streamflow runoff is being spread. Figure 1 shows a typical plan of a multiple \nbasin recharge project diverting water from a stream. \n \nFigure 1: Typical plan of a multiple basin recharge project dive rting water from a stream \n(Source: ASCE, 1972). \nStream-channel Method \nA naturally losing channel can provide water for recharge over a greater area and longer period \nof time. In order to enhance infiltration both upstream management of flow and channel \nmodifications are required. Upstream modifications may include reservoirs which regulate \nerratic runoff and limit the flow rates within the absorptive capacity of downstream channels. \n\nChannel modifications may includ e widening, leveling, scarifying or ditching to enhance \ninfiltration. Flow can also be diverted along the channel into basins located alongside the \nchannel to increase recharge by aiding in basin method. \nDitch and Furrow Method \nA series of shallow, flat bo ttomed, closely spaced ditches or furrows constructed alongside a \nchannel are used for improving infiltration. The properties of ditches are suited to obtain \nmaximum water contact area. Three basic layouts are available for this system: (1) Contour, \nwhere ditches follow the ground contour; (2) Tree shaped, whe",
    "e properties of ditches are suited to obtain \nmaximum water contact area. Three basic layouts are available for this system: (1) Contour, \nwhere ditches follow the ground contour; (2) Tree shaped, where the main canal branches into \nditches; (3) Lateral, where a series of ditches extend laterally from the canal.  \nFlooding Method \nThis method is employed in relatively flat topography. Figure 2  shows the s chematic \nrepresentation of ditch and furrow method. Water is allowed to spread evenly over a large area, \nforming a thin sheet over the land, moving at a minimum velocity so as not to disturb the soil. \nIn order to control the water, embankments or ditches should surround the whole flooding area. \nThis method costs least of all the methods for land preparation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Schematic representation of ditch and furrow method (Source: megphed.gov.in). \n \nIrrigation Method \n \n\nIn croplands, water can be deliberately allowed to spread for recharge. This deliberate action \nhas to be carefully timed, usually during winter months or non-irrigating periods so as to ensure \nleast loss by evaporation. No additional cost for land preparat ion is needed as the distribution \nsystem is already in place. Irrigation canals can be kept full to allow water to seep and increase \ninfiltration. Utmost care has to be taken to prevent water logging and leaching of water \ncontaminated with salts or carrying soil nutrients which would otherwise adversely affect the \ncrop yield. \nRecharge by Pit Method \nA pit excavated into permeable soil can serve as a groundwater recharge facility. In order to \navoid high excavation costs, abandoned pits such as gravel p its should be used. Areas having \nlow permeable clay layers on top can restrict surface infiltration, so pits can be the solution \nhere as they can reach lower permeable strata. Besides being economical, recharge pits can \nalso counter silting. The silt settl es at the bottom, leaving the walls unclogged for continued \nfi",
    "lution \nhere as they can reach lower permeable strata. Besides being economical, recharge pits can \nalso counter silting. The silt settl es at the bottom, leaving the walls unclogged for continued \nfiltration of water. The design should be given proper consideration in order to ensure optimum \ninfiltration rate. \n \nFigure 3. Cross-sectional view of a recharge pit. \nGroundwater Dams \n\nA dam is built across a river or stream for collection and storage of surface water. A \ngroundwater dam also serves as a collecting structure purposed to divert groundwater to \nrecharge an adjacent aquifer or to raise the groundwater table of an aquifer. This need of  \ngroundwater dam arises due to the erratic rainfall. It is a means to bridge over the seasonal dry \nperiods. \nRecharge Well \nA recharge well admits water from surface to aquifers. A recharge well’s flow is reverse of a \npumping well, but its construction may o r may not be same.  The radial flow from recharge \nwells penetrating (a) confined and (b) unconfined aquifers are given in Figure 3.  When water \nis admitted into a recharge well, a cone of recharge will be formed that is similar in shape but \nreverse of a cone of depression surrounding a pumping well.  \n                                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

(a) Recharging dug well, (b) Recharging bore well and (c) Recharge Trench  \nSprinkling Infiltration  \nSprinkling infiltration is a groundwater recharge technique which is done by infiltrating surface \nwater through forest soil. This method has been introduced in Finland. On the basis of studies \ncarried out by Kaarakka et al. (2019), this method is an environment altering soil treatment, \nwhich results in long term neutral ization of the forest soil and i nfiltration induced changes in \nsoil dynamics could potentially be long-lasting and soil recovery from such a treatment may \ntake years, if not decades. \nRainwater Harvesting (RWH) \nRainwater harvesting (RWH) is the process of collecting and storing water for future \nproductive use and is an important environment friendly approach with double benefit in both \nkeeping the groundwater table undisturbed and charging the aquifer.  Broadly, there are two \nways of harvesting rainwater, one is surface water harvesting and the other is rooftop rainwater \n\nharvesting. Rainwater harvesting techniques can be coupled with artificial groundwater \nrecharge techniques. In a stu dy by Alataway et al. (2018 ) of the centralized RWH system to \nrecharge groundwater in Wadi Al-Alb region of Sauid Arabia, it was found that losses due to \nevaporation could be mitigated by drilling recharge bore wells in the reservoirs. However, \nperiodic cleaning and maintenance of the wells is necessary to prevent clogging by siltation.  \nTreated wastewater can also be  a viable source of water for artificial groundwater recharge. \nAmong various challenges of treating wastewater and reusing it, the most prevalent is the \npsychological barrier of the users.

Case study on an aquifer in Cyprus by Kostas (2011) shows \nthat recharging of groundwater using pre -treated wastewater via deep boreholes is a feasible \noption. Clogging of recharge borehole should be considered while designing and appropriate \nmeasures should be taken to avoid such problems. Further, groundwater can also be recharged \nthrough wetlands. In a study by Adarsh et al. (2019), it was found that paddy fields effectively \nact as artificial wetlands which recharge ground water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

    "PREFACE\nThe dependence on ground water as a reliable source for meeting the requirements for\nirrigation, drinking and industrial uses in India has been rising rapidly during the last few\ndecades. Ground water development has occupied an important place in Indian economy\nbecause of its role in stabilizing agriculture and as a means for drought management. Over the\nyears, particularly since the launching of Five Year Plans, there have been continued efforts in\nIndia for development of ground water resources to meet the increasing demands of water\nsupply for various sectors. In many parts of the country, ground water development has\nalready reached a critical stage, resulting in acute scarcity of the resource. Over- development\nof the ground water resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water\nsupply, intrusion of saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water abstraction structures. These have serious implications on the\nenvironment and the socio-economic conditions of the populace. Worsening ground water\nquality has also adversely affected the availability of fresh ground water in several areas. The\nprevailing scenario of ground water development and management in India calls for urgent\nsteps for augmentation of ground water resources to ensure their long-term sustainability. The\ndiverse nature of the terrain and complexities of hydrogeological settings prevailing in the\ncountry makes this a challenging task.\nCentral Ground Water Board has been in the forefront of activities for augmenting ground\nwater resources through scientifically designed artificial recharge structures for harvesting\nnon-committed surplus runoff which otherwise runs off into sea. A number of pilot schemes\nand demonstrative artificial recharge schemes have been implemented by the Board in\nassociation with various State Government organizations since the 8 th plan period.

    "ificial recharge schemes have been implemented by the Board in\nassociation with various State Government organizations since the 8 th plan period. These are\naimed at popularizing cost-effective ground water augmentation techniques suitable for\nvarious hydrogeological settings, to be replicated by other agencies elsewhere in similar areas.\nBased on the valuable experience gained from such activities, the Board has also brought out\na number of publications on various aspects of artificial recharge. The ‘Manual on Artificial\nRecharge of Ground Water’ is the latest in this series and has updated information on various\naspects of investigation techniques for selection of sites, planning and design of artificial\nrecharge structures, their economic evaluation, monitoring and technical auditing of schemes\nand issues related to operation and maintenance of these structures. Roof top rainwater\nharvesting, suitable especially for urban habitations is also dealt with in detail. This\npublication will be of immense use to all those who are engaged in planning and\nimplementation of ground water augmentation schemes in various parts of the country.\nThe work done by Central Ground Water Board and other Central, State and non-\ngovernmental agencies involved in the water sector have provided the basic inputs necessary\nfor the preparation of this manual. I would like to specially acknowledge the efforts of\nShri.C.S.Ramasesha, Commissioner (GW) and Member (SML) (Retd), Shri.Nandakumaran.P,\nDr.S.K.Jain, Shri.K.R.Sooryanarayana and Shri.Y.B.Kaushik, Senior Hydrogeologists, in\nbringing out this publication.\nI hope this manual will be useful to all agencies engaged in planning and implementation of\nartificial recharge schemes across the country in a scientific manner to ensure optimum\nbenefits.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background\nGround water, which is the source for more than 85 percent of India’s rural domestic\nwater requirements, 50 percent of its urban water requirements and more than 50\npercent of its irrigation requirements is depleting fast in many areas due to its large-\nscale withdrawal for various sectors.  For example, out of a total of 5723 assessment\nunits (Blocks/Mandals/Talukas) in the country, 839 have been categorised as ‘Over-\nexploited’ as assessed on 31 st March 2004, with ground water extraction in excess of\nthe net annual recharge. There are also 226 ‘Critical’ assessment units where the\nground water draft is between 90 and 100 percent of the annual replenishment, apart\nfrom 30 blocks having only saline ground water (CGWB, 2006).\nThere have been continued efforts in India for development of ground water resources\nto meet the increasing demands of water supply, especially in the last few decades.  In\ncertain high demand areas, ground water development has already reached a critical\nstage, resulting in acute scarcity of the resource. Over- development of the ground\nwater resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water supply,\nintrusion of saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water structures.

    "and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water structures. Geogenic contamination of ground water due to\nconcentration of Arsenic, Fluoride and Iron in excess of limits prescribed for drinking\npurposes (BIS, 2004) have also been observed in many parts of the country. To tackle\nthe twin hazards of de-saturation of aquifer zones and consequent deterioration of\nground water quality, there is an urgent need to augment the ground water resources\nthrough suitable management interventions. Artificial recharge has now been accepted\nworld-wide as a cost-effective method to augment ground water resources in areas\nwhere continued overexploitation without due regard to their recharging options has\nresulted in various undesirable environmental consequences.\nA ‘Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water’, providing detailed guidelines on\ninvestigative techniques for selection of sites, planning and design of artificial\nrecharge structures, monitoring and economic evaluation of artificial recharge\nschemes was brought out by Central Ground Water Board in 1994. It also included\nelaborate case studies and field examples of artificial recharge schemes from different\nparts of the world. The manual has been used extensively for planning and\nimplementation of schemes for augmentation of ground water resources by various\nagencies.\nSubsequent to the publication of the manual, Central Ground Water Board has\nbrought out five publications on the topic in an attempt to disseminate the experiences\ngained during various ground water augmentation projects implemented by the Board\nin the country. They are:\n1) Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water (1994).\n2) National Perspective Plan for Recharge to Ground Water by Utilising Surplus\nMonsoon Runoff  (1996)\n3) Guide on Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (1998)\n4) Guide on Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (2000)\n5) Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (2002)\nIntroduction\nManual on Artificial Recharge",

Some of the State Departments have also brought out manuals and\nguidelines on artificial recharge to ground water, which dealt with specific areas in\nmost cases.\n1.2 Present Endeavour\nDuring 2004, it was decided to revise and update the existing manual by incorporating\nthe latest advances in the fields of rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge.\nAccordingly, a Committee of the following officers was constituted:\nShri.

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO\n2.1 Global and Indian Water Scenario\nMany of us have an image of the world as a blue planet as 70 percent of the earth’s\nsurface is covered with water.  The reality, however, is that 97 percent of the total\nwater on earth of about 1400 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) is saline and only 3 percent\nis available as fresh water. About 77 percent of this fresh water is locked up in\nglaciers and permanent snow and 11 percent is considered to occur at depths\nexceeding 800 m below the ground, which cann",
    "available as fresh water. About 77 percent of this fresh water is locked up in\nglaciers and permanent snow and 11 percent is considered to occur at depths\nexceeding 800 m below the ground, which cannot be extracted economically with the\ntechnology available today. About 11 percent of the resources are available as\nextractable ground water within 800 m depth and about 1 percent is available as\nsurface water in lakes and rivers. Out of the 113,000 BCM of rain and snow received\non the earth, evaporation losses account for about 72,000 BCM, leaving a balance of\nabout 41,000 BCM, out of which about 9000-14000 BCM is considered utilizable.\nThe annual precipitation including snowfall in India is of the order of 4000 BCM and\nthe natural runoff in the rivers is computed to be about 1869 BCM. The utilizable\nsurface water and replenishable ground water resources are of the order of 690 BCM\nand 433 BCM respectively. Thus, the total water resources available for various uses,\non an annual basis, are of the order of 1123 BCM. Although the per capita availability\nof water in India is about 1869 cubic meters as in 1997 against the benchmark value\nof 1000 Cu m signifying ‘water-starved’ condition ( Fig.2.1), there is wide disparity in\nbasin-wise water availability due to uneven rainfall and varying population density in\nthe country. The availability is as high as 14057 cu m per capita in Brahmaputra/\nBarak Basin and as low as 307 cu m in Sabarmati basin. Many other basins like Mahi,\nTapi, Pennar are already water stressed.\n2.2 Historical Perspective\nIndia is a vast country with very deep historical roots and strong cultural traditions.\nThese are reflected in our social fabric and institutions of community life.  In spite of\nsocial movements of varied nature through the millennia, we have retained the spirit\nand essence of these traditions and have remained attached to our roots.

    "ve retained the spirit\nand essence of these traditions and have remained attached to our roots.  Some of our\ntraditions, evolved and developed by our ancestors thousands of years ago have\nplayed important roles in different spheres of our life. One of the most important\namong these is the tradition of collecting, storing and preserving water for various\nuses.\nThe tradition probably started at the dawn of civilization with small human\nsettlements coming up on the banks of rivers and streams.  When, due to vagaries of\nnature, rivers and streams dried up or the flow in them dwindled, they moved away to\nlook for more reliable sources of water.  In due course of time, large settlements came\nup along the banks of perennial rivers that provided plentiful water. As the population\nincreased, settlements developed into towns and cities and agriculture expanded.\nTechniques were developed to augment water availability by collecting and storing\nrainwater, tapping hill and underground springs and water from snow and glacier melt\netc.  Water came to be regarded as precious and its conservation and preservation was\nsanctified by religion. Various religious, cultural and social rituals prescribed\nWater Resources Development Scenario\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 5\npurification and cleansing with water.

Emperors and kings not only built various water bodies but also\nencouraged the village communities and individuals to build these on their own.\nWide-ranging laws were enacted to regulate their construction and maintenance and\nfor conservation and preservation of water and its proper distribution and use.\nFig. 2.1 Per capita Water availability in India.\nThe Satavahanas (1 st C e",

Lake and well irrigation techniques were developed on\na large scale during the time of Pandya, Chera and Chola dynasties in south India (1st\nto 3 rd Century A.D) and large dams were built across Cauvery and Vaigai ri v e r s .

Under the rule of Rangila Muhammad Shah, the Eastern Yamuna\nCanal was built to irrigate large tracts in Uttar Pradesh.\nThe Vijaynagar Kings (1336-1548 A.D.) in the south took keen interest in building\nlarge and small storage tanks.

In the\npeninsular part, where rivers are not perennial and rainfall is scanty, the practice of\ntrapping storm water in large tanks for agricultural and domestic purposes was\npopular. In areas where high ground water table permitted lift irrigation, wells were\ncommon. The Grand Anicut across Cauvery River still remains by far one of the\ngreatest engineering feats of ancient India. The Viranrayana and\nGangaikondacholapuram t a n k s i n T a m i l N a d u a n dAnantaraja Sagara  in Andhra\nPradesh were constructed in the 10 th and 13 th centuries. The Western and Eastern\nYamuna Canals and Hasli Canal in the Ravi were dug in the 16th and 18th centuries.\nUnder the British rule, irrigation development continued with renovation and\ni m p r o v e m e n t o f e x i s t i n g i r r i g a t i o n w o r k s a n d w i t h t h i s e x p e r i e n c e , m o r e n e w\ndiversion works such as Upper Ganga Canal, Upper Bari Doab Canal, Krishna and\nGodavari delta systems were taken up and completed between 1836 and 1866.  By the\nsecond half of the 19 th century, irrigation potential to the tune of about 7.5 million\nhectares (m ha) had been developed.\nBased on recommendations of the First Irrigation Commission, the period during\n1900-1947 saw more irrigation development and the potential created increased to\n2 2 . 5 m h a a t t h e ti m e of i n d e p e n d e n c e .

Construction of large storages like Bhakra, Hirakud,\nNagarjunasagar - called by Pandit Nehru as ‘Temples of Modern India’, were taken\nup and completed. The criteria for economic evaluation of storage projects were\nch an ged f rom th e f i nanci al return eval uati on to a b en efi t- cos t ra ti o ev al uati on . Th e\nreturn to the Government on investment was, thus, no more relevant but benefit to the\nfarmer (at a cost to the Government) became the main evaluation criterion. The\ndevelopment of irrigation potential took place in successive plans by leaps and bounds\nan d reach ed an i m pres si ve 89.5 m h a by th e en d of th e Ei gh th Fi ve Year Pl an . The\ncountry achieved self-sufficiency in food grains by producing 200 million tones (MT)\nand import of food grains became a thing of the past.\nThe Second Irrigation Commission, set up in 1969, while not advocating any major\nchange in the policy of irrigation development, cautioned in its report that areas like\nconjunctive use of surface and ground water, command area development, watershed\nd e v el opm en t, i n c r e a s e i n w a te r r a te s t o m e e t O & M c os ts a s w el l a s a p a r t of th e\ninterest on investment also needed attention.\nIn pursuan",

These measures have met with varying\ndegrees of success and have had a bearing on the irrigation development achieved so\nfar and also in shaping the future strategy in this sector.\nGround water development in India is primarily sustained by the farmers themselves\nor by institutional finance.  The public sector outlay is mostly limited to ground water\nsurveys, construction of deep tube wells for community irrigation, services provided\nand grants extended to small and marginal farmers. The flow of institutional finance is\ngenerally about 60 percent of the total outlay for ground water development.\nGround water development has, therefore, occupied an important place in Indian\neconomy because of its role in stabilizing agriculture and as a means for drought\nmanagement.  During periods of droughts, additional dependence is laid on this\nresource since the storage levels in surface reservoirs dwindle and the impact of\nvagaries of weather on ground water is not as pronounced or is delayed.  The stage of\nground water development in the country as estimated in 1991 was about 32 percent.\nBy March 2004, the stage of development has reached approximately 58 percent. This\nis also evident from the growth of ground water abstraction structures from the pre-\nplan period till date.\nThe number of ground water abstraction structures has increased from 5.8 million in\n1982-83 to more than 18.5 million in 2000-2001.

It is not only the main source for water supply in urban areas\nfor domestic uses, but also is the largest and most productive source of irrigation\nwater. The investments in this sector, as part of Minor Irrigation by public and private\nsector, are going on since independence. The Minor Irrigation potential created, which\nwas just 32 percent during the 1 st Plan, increased to 84.4 percent during the 7 th Plan\nperiod (1992-1997).  This is in spite of the fact that investment in Minor Irrigation\nSector had been decreasing in subsequent plans from 56.6 percent (1966-69 Annual\nPlan) to 19.7 percent (1997-2000) of the total plan outlay for irrigation.\nGround water irrigation began to expand rapidly with the large-scale cultivation of\nhigh yielding crop varieties in the second half of the 1960s.

Because\nagriculture and allied activities contribute roughly 30 percent of India’s Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP), with crops accounting for three- fourths of this, the\ncon tri b uti on of groun d wate r (wi th a package of as s oci ate i n puts ) to In di a’s GDP i s\nabout 9 percent. The relation between new technology and ground water development\nhas been two-way. Not only has ground water irrigation helped to spread new\ntechnology, some of the profits earned through new technologies have been ploughed\nback into ground water development, leading to the well- known “tub well explosion”\nin northwest India. This was facilitated by the government’s efforts to promote rural\nelectrification and the banking industry’s institutional credit support, especially after\n1969.\nThe significance of ground water in the economy is due to the fact that agricultural\nyields are generally higher by one – third to half in areas irrigated with ground water\nthan in areas irrigated with water from other sources.  This is primarily due to the fact\nthat ground water offers greater control over the supply of water when compared to\nother sources of irrigation. As a result, ground water irrigation encourages\ncomplementary investments in fertilizers, pesticides, and high-yielding crop varieties,\nleading to higher yields.\nThe strong link between ground water and economic growth has underlain the\ndevelopment strategy of the country. A special agricultural strategy launched for\neastern India (comprising eastern U.P, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, and\neastern Madhya Pradesh) in the mid 1980s, for instance, relied heavily on the\nexploitation of ground water.

    "1980s, for instance, relied heavily on the\nexploitation of ground water.  Since 1987, drilling of free tube wells and subsidies for\npump sets have been provided throughout the region. This approach appears to have\npaid rich dividends. Rice production, the main food crop of this region, increased\nrapidly and reasonable progress was made on poverty reduction.\nDevelopment of ground water has led to increased “drought proofing” of India’s\nagricultural economy. In the 1960s, ground water was a relatively insignificant source\nof irrigation, particularly in eastern India. In 1965-66, monsoon rainfall (June to\nSeptember) was 20 percent below normal, leading to drought conditions, which\nresulted in the decline of food production by 19 percent at the national level. In\ncontrast, in 1987-88, rainfall was almost 18 percent below normal, but food grain\nproduction declined only by 2 percent over the previous year’s level. Much of this\nimprovement can be attributed to the spread of irrigation in general and of ground\nwater irrigation in particular.\nThe impact of Ground water development has extended beyond the owners of wells.\nStudies have indicated that farmers who own wells achieve the highest yields, while\nfarmers who purchase water achieve higher yields than farmers who depend on canal\nirri gati on al one, but not as hi gh as the yields achieved by the owners of wells. They\nalso consume more fertilizer, labour, and other inputs. Thus, the expansion of ground\nwater irrigation is a major catalyst for rural development.\nGround water plays a key contributory role to agricultural GDP and drought\nmitigation. The spread of ground water irrigation supports employment generation\nand thus rural development and poverty alleviation.

As productivity is higher in irrigated land, better access to irrigation reduces\npoverty in rural areas.\n2.4 Emerging Challenges\nGround water management is the foremost challenge being faced today by the\norganizations dealing with ground water in India.  The activities and policies affecting\nground water need to reflect the priority issues with the overall objective of providing\nwater security through ground water management in a major part of the country.\nCentral Ground Water Board, being the apex organization at the central level with\nvast experience in the ground water sector, has taken a proactive role in identifying\nvarious key issues, which need immediate attention.  These issues are discussed below\nin brief\n2.4.1 Ground Water Depletion\nIndiscriminate ground water development has led to substantial ground water level\ndeclines both in hard rocks and alluvial areas threatening sustainability of this\nresource.    Long-term decline of ground water levels is being observed in many areas,\nm os tl y i n th e s tates of Raj as th an , Guj arat, Tam il Nadu, Punj ab , Del hi an d Hary an a.\nApart form this, in most of the cities depending on ground water for drinking water\nsupplies, water level declines up to 30 m and more have been observed. Traditional\nwater harvesting methods, which were in vogue in arid and semi-arid areas of the\ncountry have either been abandoned or have become defunct in most cases. There is\nan urgent need to revive these methods.\nIn some parts of the country like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi, the in-\nstorage or static ground water resources are also limited and depletion in ground water\nlevel is resulting in ground water drought scenario.  In such areas, it may become very\ndi f f i c ul t f or th e S ta te t o p r ov i de w a te r s e c u ri ty f or v a r i ou s u s e r s . E x c e s s i v e g",

E x c e s s i v e g r ou n d\nwater development has resulted in deterioration of ground water quality in coastal\nareas due to saline water ingress.  Ground water development, therefore, needs to be\nregulated and augmented through suitable measures to provide sustainability and\nprotection.  Dependence on use of ground water for agriculture due to monsoon\nfailures is accelerating ground water depletion. Excessive withdrawal of ground water\nis further compounding the stress on ground water system due to free/subsidized\npower in some States. In order to tackle the burgeoning problem of water level\ndecline, it is necessary to take up schemes for water conservation and artificial\nrecharge to ground water on priority.\n2.4.2 Ground Water Pollution\nGround water resources in several areas of the country are getting polluted due to over\napplication of fertilizers and pesticides, indiscriminate disposal of effluents from\nindustries and urban sewerage. Surveillance studies to determine the type and\nmigration of pollution and measures for its control have become an absolute necessity\nfrom the point of view of long-term sustainability of ground water resources. Purpose-\ndriven studies need to be undertaken to find suitable mitigation measures to combat\nthis problem.\nWater Resources Development Scenario\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 11\nPresence of naturally occurring Arsenic, Fluoride and Iron in ground water in excess\nof permissible limits recommended for human consumption prohibits its use for\ndrinking purposes in several states of India.

Dilution of\npollutant concentration through ground water recharge can be one of the effective\nways to mitigate the hazards of high concentration of these constituents. It is also\ndesirable that rural water supply schemes be formulated and arrangements made to\nutilize fluoride / arsenic rich water for purposes other than drinking.\n2.4.3 Drinking Water Shortage in Urban Areas\nThere are several urban areas in the country where water supply systems are based\nmainly on ground water resource.  Sustainability of urban water supply is one of the\ncore issues the planners across the country are facing at present. The problem may get\naggravated in near future with the rapid pace of urbanization being witnessed in India.\nPotable drinking water is an important input for providing municipal supply to the\nu r b a n c o m p l e x e s .

These problems could be solved to some extent by\ni) Shifting of ground water pumpage from the center of the cities to flood\nplain areas having proven capabilities of sustaining high yielding tube wells\nwherever possible,\nii) Recycling and reuse of water,\niii) Dual water supply systems for drinking and other domestic uses,\niv) Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting and\nv) Regulatory measures through proper pricing and metering of water\nsupplied.\n2.4.4 Seawater Ingress in Coastal Aquifers\nThe unconsolidated deltaic and coastal sediments form thick and regionally extensive\naquifers having prolific yield potential that can sustain deep, moderate to high\ncapacity tube wells.

The ground water in these\naquifers exists in a fragile dynamic equilibrium with seawater.

Coastal aquifers in parts of Gujarat, Tamil\nNadu and Andhra Pradesh are already suffering from the problem of salinity ingress.\nMeasures to prevent/control saline water intrusion into coastal aquifers include\ni) Regulation of ground water development in coastal areas.\nii) Formation of a freshwater ridge parallel to the coast through artificial\nrecharge.\niii) Formation of a pumping trough through a series of pumping wells\naligned parallel to the coast\nArtificial Recharge of Ground Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 12\n3. ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE OF GROUND WATER\nThe term artificial recharge has different connotations for various practitioners.\nA r ti f i ci al r ech a r g e to g r ou n d w a te r i s d ef i n e d as th e r e ch a r g e th a t oc c u r s w h en th e\nnatural pattern of recharge is deliberately modified to increase recharge (ASCE\n2001).

What is artificial is\nth e av ail abili ty of water s upply at a parti cul ar l ocati on an d a parti cul ar ti m e. In th e\nbroadest sense one can define artificial recharge as “any procedure, which introduces\nwater in a pervious stratum”.\nThe term artificial recharge refers to transfer of surface water to the aquifer by human\ninterference. The natural process of recharging the aquifers is accelerated through\np e r c o l a ti o n of s t o r e d o r f l o w i n g s u r f a c e w",

Artificial recharge is also defined as the process by which ground\nwater is augmented at a rate exceeding that under natural condition of replenishment.\nTherefore, any man-made facility that adds water to an aquifer may be considered as\nartificial recharge (CGWB, 1994)\nArtificial recharge aims at augmenting the natural replenishment of ground water\nstorage by some method of construction, spreading of water, or by artificially\nchanging natural conditions. It is useful for reducing overdraft, conserving surface\nrun-off, and increasing available ground water supplies. Recharge may be incidental\nor deliberate, depending on whether or not it is a by-product of normal water\nutilization.\nA rti f i ci al rech arge can al s o b e def i ned as a proce s s of i nduced repl eni shm en t of th e\nground water reservoir by human activities.

Concept of Recharge\nFlow below the land surface takes place due to the process of infiltration. The soil will\nnot get completely saturated with water unless water supply is maintained for\nprolonged periods. If water is applied only intermittently, there may be no recharge\nduring the first infiltration or even between two subsequent infiltrations. The\nevolution of water in the soil during the period between two instances of infiltration is\nreferred to as redistribution. Recharge may take place even when no hydraulic\nconnection is established between the ground surface and the underlying aquife",
    "od between two instances of infiltration is\nreferred to as redistribution. Recharge may take place even when no hydraulic\nconnection is established between the ground surface and the underlying aquifer.\nThe hydraulic effects generated by artificial recharge are basically of two types, viz.\npiezometric effect and volumetric effect. The piezometric effect results in a rise of the\npiezometric surface, the magnitude of which depends on the geologic and hydraulic\nboundaries of the aquifer being recharged and the type, location, yield and duration of\nt h e r e c h a r g e m e c h a n i s m .

Other factors such as capillary forces, water temperature and presence of\nair bubbles in the aquifer also have an impact on the piezometric effect.\nThe volumetric effect is related to the specific yield, replenishment coefficient,\ntransmissivity and the geologic and hydraulic boundaries of the aquifer. Model studies\nthat were checked through field experiments have demonstrated that the bulk of the\nArtificial Recharge of Ground Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 13\nrecharge water moves according to two systems of flow, one resulting in a spreading-\nout effect with a speed related to the recharge flow and the other in a sliding effect,\nwith a speed related to ground water flow.\n3.2 Need for Artificial Recharge\nNatural replenishment of ground water reservoir is a slow process and is often unable\nto keep pace with the excessive and continued exploitation of ground water resources\nin various parts of the country. This has resulted in declining ground water levels and\ndepletion of ground water resources in such areas.

    "resources in such areas. Artificial recharge efforts are\nbasically aimed at augmentation of the natural movement of surface water into ground\nwater reservoir through suitable civil construction techniques. Such techniques inter-\nrelate and integrate the source water to ground water reservoir and are dependent on\nthe hydrogeological situation of the area concerned.\nOccurrence of rainfall in India is mostly limited to about three months in a year. The\nnatural recharge to ground water reservoir is restricted to this period only in a major\npart of the country. Artificial recharge techniques aim at extending the recharge\nperiod in the post-monsoon season for about three or more months, resulting in\nenhanced sustainability of ground water sources during the lean season.\nIn arid regions of the country, rainfall varies between 150 and 600 mm/ year with less\nthan 10 rainy days. A major part of the precipitation is received in 3 to 5 major storms\nlasting only a few hours. The rates of potential evapotranspiration (PET) are\nexceptionally high in these areas, often ranging from 300 to 1300 mm. In such cases,\nthe average annual PET is much higher than the rainfall and the annual water resource\nplanning has to be done by conserving the rainfall, by storing the available water\neither in surface or in sub-surface reservoirs. In areas where climatic conditions are\nnot favourable for creating surface storage, artificial recharge techniques have to be\nadopted for diverting most of the surface storage to the ground water reservoirs within\nthe shortest possible time.\nIn hilly areas, even though the rainfall is comparatively high, scarcity of water is often\nfelt in the post-monsoon season, as most of the water available is lost as surface run-\noff.  Springs, the major source of water in such terrains, are also depleted during the\npost monsoon period.

In such areas, rainwater harnessing and small surface storages\nat strategic locations in the recharge areas of the springs can provide sustainable\nyields to the springs as well as enhance the recharge during and after rainy season.\n3.3 Purposes and Principles of Artificial Recharge\nThere are many reasons why water is deliberately placed into storage in ground water\nreservoirs. A large percentage of artificial recharge projects are designed to replenish\nground water resources in depleted aquifers and to conserve water for future use.\nOther such projects recharge water for various objectives such as control of salt-water\nencroachment, filtration of water, control of land subsidence, disposal of wastes and\nrecovery of oil from partially depleted oil fields.\nIn certain coastal areas of the world, artificial recharge systems for blocking inland\ne n c r o a c h m e n t o f s e a w a t e r a r e i n o p e r a t i o n .

In such schemes, most of the injected water is not directly available\nArtificial Recharge of Ground Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 14\nfor use, but serves as a hydraulic mechanism to allow better use of existing ground\nwater reserves.\nAttempts have been made in a few places to overcome land subsidence caused by\nexcessive extraction of ground water by forcing water under pressure into the\nunderlying ground water reservoirs. The success of such experiments of\nrepressurizing to stop land subsidence is inconclusive.\nF r o m t h e p o i n t o f v i e w o f a r t i f i c i a l l y s t o r i n g w a t e r f o r f u t u r e u s e , t h e b a s i c\nrequirement is to be able to obtain water in adequate amounts and at the proper times\nin order to accom",

Another approach is\nto treat and reclaim used water being discharged from sewer systems or industrial\nestablishments.\n3.4 Advantages of Artificial Recharge\nArtificial recharge is becoming increasingly necessary to ensure sustainable ground\nwater supplies to satisfy the needs of a growing population. The benefits of artificial\nrecharge can be both tangible and intangible. The important advantages of artificial\nrecharge are\nx Subsurface storage space is available free of cost and inundation is avoided\nx Evaporation losses are negligible\nx Quality improvement by infiltration through the permeable media\nx Biological purity is very high\nx It has no adverse social impacts such as displacement of population, loss of scarce\nagricultural land etc\nx Temperature variations are minimum\nx It is environment friendly, controls soil erosion and flood and provides sufficient\nsoil moisture even during summer months\nx Water stored underground is relatively immune to natural and man-made\ncatastrophes\nx It provides a natural distribution system between recharge and discharge points\nx Results in energy saving due to reduction in suction and delivery head as a result\nof rise in water levels\n3.5 Implementation of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nSuccessful implementation of artificial recharge schemes will essentially involve the\nfollowing major components\n¾ Assessment of source water\n¾ Planning o",

SOURCE WATER\nAvailability of source water is one of the basic prerequisites for taking up any\nartificial recharge scheme. The source water available for artificial recharge could be\nof the following types:\ni) Insitu precipitation in the watershed / area\nii) Nearby stream/ spring / aquifer system\niii) Surface water (canal) supplies from large reservoirs located within the\nwatershed/basin\niv) Surface water supplies through trans-basin water transfer\nv) Treated Municipal/industrial wastewaters\nvi) Any other specific source(s)\nThe availability of water for artificial recharge from all these sources may vary\nconsiderably from place to place. In any given situation, the following information\nmay be required for a realistic assessment of the source water available for recharge.\ni) The quantum of non-committed water available for recharge\nii) Time for which the source water will be available.\niii) Quality of source water and the pre-treatment required.\niv) Conveyance system required to bring the water to the proposed recharge\nsite.\nRainfall and runoff available constitute the major sources of water for artificial\nrecharge of ground water. Rainfall is the primary source of recharge into the ground\nwater reservoir. Other important sources of recharge include seepage from tanks,\ncanals and streams and the return flow from applied irrigation.

These are elaborated in the following\nsections.\n4.1 Rainfall\nRainfall in the country is typically monsoonal in nature. ‘Monsoon’ literally means\nseasonal wind. It is basically a part of the trade wind system. The southeast trade\nwinds and northeast trade winds converge at the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone\n(ITCZ). Due to uneven distribution of land and water masses, it is crooked in shape\nand keeps shifting seasonally. During its northwards movement, it draws the southeast\nt r a d e s a l o n g w i th i t .

Hence, these\nseasonal winds are named Southwest monsoon. It lasts for four months, from June to\nSeptember. While traversing the vast stretches of water, (Bay of Bengal and Arabian\nSea), these winds pick up lot of moisture. On an average, annually, about 1120 mm of\nrainfall is received in the country. Bulk of this rainfall occurs during Southwest\nmonsoon.\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 16\nThese moisture-laden winds normally hits the Kerala coast around May end. As it\nadvances over the peninsula, copious amounts of rainfall occur all along the west\ncoast and the adjoining mountains.  After crossing the mountains, the current\nweakens. At the same time, the Bay of Bengal branch of the monsoon gives rise to\nheavy rainfall in the Bay islands during the month of May.

This\nmonsoon lasts for nearly three months, from October to December. It is a relatively\ndry season as compared to its summer cousin. It is largely confined to the southeast\nand interior southern parts of the country. Rainfall is confined mainly to the month of\nOctober and to a lesser extent up to the middle of November.\n4.1.1 Measurement of Rainfall\nRainfall is measured by a rain gauge, either manual or automatic. It is installed in an\nopen area on a concrete foundation. The distance of the rain gauge from the nearest\nobject should be at least twice the height of the object.  It should never be on a terrace\nor under a tree.  The gauge as also other instruments may be fenced with a gate to\nprevent animals and unauthorized persons from entering the premises. Measurements\nare to be made at a fixed time, normally at 0830 hrs. In case of heavy rainfall areas,\nmeasurements are made as often as possible.\nFig. 4.1 Non-recording Rain Gauge\n\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 17\nA manual gauge is basically a collector (funnel) and a bottle ( Fig 4.1).

    "Source Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 17\nA manual gauge is basically a collector (funnel) and a bottle ( Fig 4.1).  It is made of\nFibreglass-reinforced Plastic. The stem of the collector or receiver is led into a bottle\nkept in the base unit.\nRainwater collected in the bottle is measured by a calibrated jar or cylinder. The\ngauges are designed on the basis of cross sectional area of the collector or funnel,\neither 200 sq cm or 100 sq cm. The former is recommended for use where rainfall in\n24 expected to be more than 200 mm. The latter is used where rainfall in a day does\nnot exceed 200 mm. Thus, one cm rain gives 100 cc of water in the bottle in the case\nof 100 sq cm collector or 200 cc in the case 200 sq cm collector.\nAn automatic rain gauge gives a continuous record of rainfall. In addition to recording\ndirectly a) the total amount of rainfall that has fallen since the record was started, b)\nth e ti m e s of on s e t a n d c es s a ti on of r ai n an d th e ref or e , c ) th e d u r a ti on of r ai n f al l . I t\nalso gives d) the rate of rainfall.  Installation procedure is the same as that for manual\ngauge.  Normally, automatic gauges are installed alongside manual gauges for use as\na s t a n d a r d , b y m e a n s o f w h i c h t h e r e a d i n g s o f t h e r e c o r d i n g r a i n g a u g e c a n b e\nchecked, and if necessary, adjusted.\nRainwater entering the gauge at the top of the cover is led via the funnel to the\nreceiver. The receiver consists of a float chamber and a siphon chamber. A pen is\nmounted on the stem of the float and as the water level rises in the receiver, the float\nri s es an d th e p en r e c or d s on a ch a r t m ou n te d on a cl oc k d r um .

If there is no rain, the pen traces a horizontal line from where it leaves off\nrising. The diameter of the funnel is 203 mm and height of the gauge is 600 mm.\nThere are other types of recording rain gauges such as tipping bucket, digital rain\ngauge etc, which facilitate telemetry of data.\n4.1.2 Rain Gauge Network\nF or pr ope r as s es sm en t of water res ou rces , a g ood n etwork of rai n gauges i s a m us t.\nThe planning of such a network primarily depends on physical factors which affect\nh y d r ol ogy s u ch a s t op og r a p h y , m or ph ol ogy , l an d u s e an d s oi l ty p es . I n h i l l y a r ea s ,\nwhere heavy rainfall characterized by extreme variability is experienced, the network\nshould be carefully planned. More the variability of rainfall, denser should be the rain\ngauge network. As per the IS: 4987-1968, the recommended rain gauge network\ndensity in plains is one rain gauge for every 520 sq km, whereas in moderately elevated\nareas (average elevation up to 1000 m), it is one in 260 to 390 sq km. Hilly areas, where\nv e r y h e a v y r a i n f a l l i s e x p e c t e d , a r e a l s o a r e a s o f e x t r e m e r a i n f a l l v a r i a b i l i t y . T h e\nnetwork density in such areas, if economically feasible, should be one rain gauge for\nevery 130 sq km. As far as possible, 10 percent of the rain gauge stations should be\nequipped with automatic (self recording) rain gauges.\nA n i m p o r ta n t f a c t o r i n th e d e s i g n of th e n e tw o r k i s th e a c c u r a c y w i th w h i c h r a i n f al l\nover the catchment is to be assessed. A relation involving optimum number of rain\ngauges required and variability of rainfall among the existing rain gauges is expressed\nas\nN = (Cv/P)2   or   P = (Cv)/(N1/2)\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 18\nwhere N is the opt",
    "required and variability of rainfall among the existing rain gauges is expressed\nas\nN = (Cv/P)2   or   P = (Cv)/(N1/2)\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 18\nwhere N is the optimum number of rain gauges, Cv is coefficient of variability of the\nrainfall values of the existing rain gauge stations and P, the permissible percentage error\nin the estimate of basin mean rainfall.\nNormally, the mean rainfall is estimated up to an error (P) not exceeding 10 percent.\nIf ‘N’ increases, the error would decrease. Thus, depending on the desired accuracy of\nthe estimate, the number of rain gauges should be planned. For micro level studies of\nsmall watersheds, the error may not exceed 5 percent. In case of routine hydrological\ninvestigations, error of estimate may not exceed 10 percent. Relative distances\nbetween the gauges, accessibility, operating costs and availability of trained observers\nare to be taken into account while setting up new gauges.\nThe allocation of additional gauges depends on the spatial distribution of existing rain\ngauging stations and the variability of rainfall over the basin. For this purpose,\nisohyets of equal intervals are drawn, based on the existing gauges. Areas between\ntwo successive isohyets and their proportion with respect to total area are computed.\nThe optimum number (i.e., existing plus additional) should be distributed to the\ndifferent isohyetal zones in proportion of their areas.\nExample: A catchment has 4 rain gauges recording an annual rainfall of 800, 540, 445\nand 410 mm.  Optimum number of rain gauges (N) required for estimating the average\ndepth of rainfall  is computed in the following manner.\nMean rainfall   =  548.75      Standard Deviation  =  176.26\nCoefficient of variation (Cv)     =   32.12\b    N=  (Cv / P)2 =   10.32  i.e. 10\n It can be seen that the existing network of 4 rain gauges is inadequate and 6 new\ngauges are to be installed for a realistic estimate of average depth of rainfall.\n4.1.3 Normals of Ra",

If th e f r e q u e n c y di s t r i b u ti on of m e an a n n u a l r ai n f al l b e c om e s s ta b l e af te r a\ncertain period, the addition of further years of observations does not add significantly to\nthe accuracy.  The length or period of record needed to achieve stability varies between\nseasons and regions.  From experience it is observed that rainfall data of 30 years is\nadequate under Indian conditions. This period encompasses dry as well as wet cycles\nand is called the normal period. Averages of normal periods are termed normals. These\nnormals need updating to account for changes in environment and land use. The current\nnormal period is 1971-2000. Normals or averages, based on data for that period are\nused for making comparisons with data of the following decade.\n4.1.4 Double Mass Curve\nConsistent rainfall data is essential for resources evaluation. Due to change of location\nof a rain gauge or its exposure conditions, the data becomes inconsistent.  This can be\nrectified by plotting cumulative rainfall of the gauge in question against average\ncumulative rainfall of a number of surrounding gauges.  Such a plot is known as a\nDouble Mass Curve (Fig. 4.2).\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 19\nFig. 4.2 Double Mass Curve\nIn case of inconsistency, there will be a change in slope of the straight plot. It is\nassumed that the average of group of stations used as basis of comparison does not have\nany inconsistency in itself. Only significant changes in slope are considered. Usually,\nvalues of previous period i.e., before change in slope are adjusted to the current period\ni.e., after change of slope. The adjustment factor is",

The apparent change can be verified, and if\nnecessary, rectified by means of double mass curves as described above. Evidence of\nreal trends may be ascertained from the study of progressive long-term averages using\n3 year or 5 year moving averages ( Fig.4.3). For three year moving average, the\nrainfall is averaged over successive three-year periods. The first average is obtained\nfor years one, two and three, the second average for years two, three and four and so\non. The first average is plotted against year two, the second one against three and so\non.  In the case of 5 year moving average, years one, two, three, four and five are\na v e r a g e d a n d p l o t t e d a g a i n s t y e a r t h r e e a n d s o o n .

The period can be changed to 7 years or even 9 years.\n\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 20\nFig. 4.3  Moving average\n4.1.6 Supplementing Data\nIt is often necessary to supplement incomplete rainfall records by estimating values that\nare missing at one or more stations. Short period missing data of say, a single storm can\nbe interpolated from an isohyetal map drawn with available data. For longer periods,\nsay a month or an year, normal rainfalls are considered for interpolation.

    "eriods,\nsay a month or an year, normal rainfalls are considered for interpolation. In one\napproach, it is assumed that the ratio of monthly or annual rainfall of two adjacent\ngauges is equal to the ratio of the normal rainfalls for the same period of the two\ngauges. It is expressed as:\nRx = Ry (Nx / Ny)\nwhere ‘x’ is the rain gauge whose records are to be interpolated  and ‘y’, the nearest rain\ngauge station. Rx is the rainfall at gauge ‘x’ and Ry, the rainfall at gauge ‘y’. Nx and\nNy are normal rainfall at ‘x’ and ‘y’ respectively.\nExample:    Rain gauge      Normal     Actual\n                        X               1125              ?\n                        Y                910             865\n      Actual Rainfall at X = 865(1125/910) = 1069\nIn another approach, at least three rain gauges with continuous records, as close to and\nas evenly spread around the gauge with missing records as possible, are chosen. If the\nnormal rainfall at each of the gauge is within 10 percent of that for the gauge with\nmissing records, then the arithmetic mean of the rainfall of the three surrounding gauges\n              Year\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 21\nis used as that of the gauge in question.  If the percentage is more than 10, the following\nequation is used:\n»¼\nº\n«¬\nª \u000e\u000e RcNc\nNxRbNb\nNxRaNa\nNxRx 3\n1\nwhere Nx, Na, Nb and Nc, are the normal rainfalls of the gauge in question and the\nthree surrounding gauges and Rx, Ra, Rb and Rc are the interpolated value of the gauge\nin question and the actuals of three gauges.\nExample :      Rain gauge      Normal     Actual\n                            A                1125          875\n                            B                  910        1021\n                            C                  765         915\n                            X                  830           ?\nRainfall at X = 1 / 3 ((( 830/1125 )* 875 )+(( 830/910 )* 1021 ) +  (( 830/765)*915 )))\n= 856.5\n4.1.7 Determination of Average Rainfall\nIn resourc",

The average is usually obtained by any of the three methods; Arith-\nmetic mean, Theissen polygon and isohyetal.  The first one is a simple average whereas\nthe other two give weighted averages.\n4.1.7.1 Arithmetic Mean Method\nIn this method, the average depth of rainfall is computed as\nP = (P1 + P2 + P3 + ………………+ P n )/ n\nwhere, P is the average rainfall, n, the number of years of data and P1, P2, P3 ……… P n ,\nprecipitations measured at stations 1, 2,3 ……… n.\n4.1.7.2 Theissen Polygon Method\nIn this method, weights are assigned to each rain gauge depending on its relative\nlocation.  This method involves constructing polygons around each gauge, which are a\nresult of perpendicular bisectors of lines joining two adjacent rain gauges.  The polygon\nth us f orm ed f orm th e b oun da ry of th e ef f ecti v e area as s um ed to b e c on tr ol l ed by th e\ngauge, or in other words, the area closer to the gauge than to any other gauge.  The ratio\nof the area of each polygon to the total area is the weight.  The average or weighted\nrainfall is the sum of the product of the rainfall and weight of each gauge.  P1 to Pn are\nthe rainfall at gauges 1 to n and A1 to An are the areas of the respective polygons (Fig.\n4.4).\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 22\nFig. 4.4 Theissen Polygons\nAn example for working out average rainfall using this method is shown inTable. 4.1.\nTable 4.1 Example to Work out Weighted Average Using Theissen Polygon\nMethod\nRainfall\n(mm)\nArea\n(sq km)\nWeight Weighted Average\nRainfall (mm)\n165 18 0.011 1.8\n371 311 0.192 71.2\n488 282 0.174 84.9\n683 311 0.192 131.1\n391 52 0.032 12.5\n757 238 0.147 111.3\n1270 212 0.131 166.4\n1143 197 0.121 138.3\nTotal 1",

Apart from\nbeing quick and easy, it yields fairly accurate results if the rain gauges are uniformly\ndistributed and are under homogeneous climate. The polygon method is laborious.\nBut once weights of each rain gauge are computed, it gives results quickly. This\nmethod takes care of non-uniform distribution of rain gauges. However, variability in\nrainfall due to elevation differences is not taken care of.

U n r e a l i s t i c r u n o f f e s t i m a t e s o f\ncatchments yield often leads to the construction of oversized or undersized structures,\nwhich, in any case, must be avoided.\nRunoff is defined as the portion of the precipitation that makes its way towards rivers\nor oceans as surface or subsurface flow. After the occurrence of infiltration and other\nloses from the precipitation (rainfall), the excess rainfall flows out through the small\nnatural channels on the land surface to the main drainage channels. Such types of flow\nare called surface flows. A part of the infiltrated rainwater moves parallel to the land\nsurface as subsurface flow, and reappears on the surface at certain other points.  Such\nflows are called interflows. Another part of the infiltrated water percolates downwards\nto ground water and moves laterally to emerge in depression and rivers and joins the\nsurface flow.  This type of flow is called the subsurface flow or ground water flow.\n4.2.1 Hydrograph\nA pl ot of th e s tr e am di s ch a r g e a gai n s t th e el a ps ed ti m e gi v e s th e f l ow h y d r og r a p h .\nThe time scale could correspond to a storm period, a month, a season, a year or any\nother si",

The stream flows are classified as perennial, intermittent and\nephemeral.  Perennial streams always carry some water on account of replenishment\nby ground water throughout the year. Intermittent streams receive varying supplies of\nground water, which is more during the wet season and dries up in the summer.\nEphemeral streams do not get any supply of ground water and behave like storm\ndrains in which the flow occurs only due to the overland flow caused by a stream.\nThese streams cause flash floods too.\n4.2.2 Estimation of Runoff\nRunoff can be estimated by various methods.

A generalised soil map of India, giving the broad\nclassification of all the major soils in India is shown in Fig.4.6. Major characteristics\nof these groups are described in Table 4.10. The classification is broad but the groups\ncan be divided into sub-groups whenever such a refinement is justified. The\ninfiltration rates and permeability of soils in different groups are shown in Table 4.11\nand Table 4.12 respectively. In these tables, infiltration rate is the rate at which water\nenters the soil at the surface and which is controlled by surface conditions and\npermeability rate is the rate at which water moves in the soil, which is controlled by\nthe nature and characteristics of soil horizons.\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 30\nFig.4.6 Hydrological Soil Groups of India.\nTable 4.10 Hydrological Soil Groups\nSoil Group Description\nA\nSoils having high infiltration rates even when thoroughly wetted and\nc o n s i s t i n g c h i e f l y o f d e e p , w e l l t o e x c e s s i v e l y d",

Thus, the basic\nassumptions for development of this method were made for urban catchments.\nHowever, this method is fairly applicable to small agricultural watersheds of 40 to 80\nhectares size (Chow, 1964).\nThe Rational method is based on the assumption that constant intensity of rainfall is\nuniformly spread over an area, and the effective rain falling on the most remote part\nof the basin takes a certain period of time, known as the time of concentration (Tc) to\narrive at the basin outlet.  If the input rate of excess rainfall on the basin continues for\nth e p e ri od of ti m e of c on c en tr a ti on , th en th e p a r t of th e ex c e s s r ai n th a t f el l i n th e\nmost remote par",

That is, the maximum rate of\noutflow will occur when the rainfall duration is equal to the time of concentration.\nThe above processes are explained in Fig. 4.7.

The runoff increases with increase in flow\nfrom remote areas of the basin to its outlet. If the rainfall continues beyond the time of\nconcentration, then there is no further increase in the runoff, and it remains constant at\nits peak value.\nFig. 4.7 Runoff Hydrograph Due to Uniform Rainfall\nThe relationship for peak runoff Qp is then expressed as\nQp =   C I A\nWhere, C = coefficient of runoff\nA = area of the catchment (drainage basin)\nI   = intensity of rainfall.\nEnd of Rainfall\nRecession curve\nTc\nEnd of Rainfall\nRecession curve\nQp\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 35\nIn metric units, this equation is expressed as.\nQp =  1    C  I  A\n        3.6\nWhere, Qp = peak runoff rate (m³/s)\nC    = coefficient of runoff\nI     = mean intensity of precipitation (mm/h) for a duration equal to time of\n                     concentration, and for an accidence probability.\nA  = area of the drainage basin (km²).\n4.2.2.3.1 Runoff Coefficient Factor (C): T h e r u n o f f c o e f f i c i e n t f a c t o r ( C )\nencompasses all other factors that affect the surface runoff, except the area (A) and\nthe intensity of rainfall (I).

The average slope of the land surface is 0.006\nand the maximum travel depth of rainfall in the catchment is approximately 1.95 km.\nThe maximum depth of rainfall in the area with a return period of 25 years is as\ntabulated in Table 4.20.\nTable 4.20 Maximum Depth of Rainfall in an Area with a Return Period of 25\nYears.\nTime duration (min) 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 60\nRain fall depth (mm) 15 25 32 45 50 53 60 65\nConsider that 2.0 Km² of the catchment area has cultivated sandy loam soil (c=0.2)\nand 3.0 Km² has light clay cultivated soil (c = 0.7).

Physical quality of recharge water refers\nto the type and amount of suspended solids, temperature, and the amount of entrapped\nair whereas chemical quality refers to type and concentration of dissolved solids and\ngases. Biological quality refers to type and concentration of living organisms.  Under\ncertain conditions, any or all of these characteristics can diminish recharge rates.\n4.3.1 Physical Quality\nIf suspended solids are present in the recharge water, surface application techniques\nare more efficient than subsurface techniques. Even though suspended particles may\ncause clogging, the infiltration surfaces are accessible for remedial treatment. Where\nindirect methods of recharge are used, suspended solids pose virtually no problem.\nUnder such conditions, induced recharge would probably be one of the best methods.\nDitch and furrows method is also well suited for large amounts of suspended solid\nl o a d s b e c a u s e t h e s t e a d y f l o w o f w a t e r i n h i b i t s s e t t l i n g .

    "recharge with turbid water, they can be used in\nseries, whereby the first basin acts as a clarifier for subsequent basins. This method\nrequires more land, however, and is feasible only where land is readily available.\nWhere suspended solid loads in recharge water are high, subsurface application\ntechniques, including deep pits, shafts, and wells, are prone to failure. Unless pre-\ntreatment measures are provided, subsurface techniques should not be considered\nwhen the source water is turbid because clogging of injection wells is particularly\ntroublesome, and well redevelopment is costly.\n4.3.2 Chemical Quality\nRecharge water should be chemically compatible with the aquifer material through\nw h i ch i t f l ows an d th e n a ti v e g r ou n d w a te r t o a v oi d ch em i cal r e a c ti on s th a t w ou l d\nreduce effective porosity and recharge capacity. Chemical precipitation and\nunfavourable exchange reactions, as well as the presence of dissolved gases, are\ncauses for concern. Cation exchange reactions involving sodium in recharge water\nmay cause clay particles to swell or disperse, thereby decreasing infiltration rate or\naquifer permeability. Dissolved gases may alter aquifer pH or come out of solution,\nforming gas pockets that occupy pore space and decrease aquifer permeability.\nToxic substances in excess of established health standards must not be present in the\nrecharge water unless they can be removed by pre-treatment or chemically\ndecomposed by a suitable land or aquifer treatment system. If artificial recharge is for\ndrinking purpose, then the source water must conform to the drinking water standards\nin vogue.\n4.3.3 Biological Quality\nBiological agents such as algae or bacteria may also be present in recharge water.\nOrganic wastes may contain harmful bacteria or promote their growth and decay or\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 40\norganic materials may produce excess nitrate or other by-products.

    "r promote their growth and decay or\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 40\norganic materials may produce excess nitrate or other by-products. Growth of algae\nand bacteria during recharge can cause clogging of infiltration surfaces and may lead\nto the production of gases that further hinder recharge efforts. Although surface\nspreading removes most bacteria and algae by filtration before the recharge water\nreaches the aquifer, surface clogging can reduce the infiltration rate considerably.\nInjection of water containing bacteria and algae through wells is generally not\nrecommended because it causes clogging of well screens or aquifer materials, which\nis difficult and costly to remedy.\nThe quality of source water is thus vitally important wherever direct recharge\ntechniques are contemplated. In cases where insitu precipitation or water supplied\nfrom canals are used for recharge, no constraints on account of water quality may\narise. However, in cases where waters in the lower reaches of rivers or recycled\nmunicipal/industrial waste waters are proposed to be used, the quality of water\nrequires to be precisely analysed and monitored to determine the type and extent of\ntreatment required.\nIn cases where the recharge is contemplated through spreading techniques, raw waste\nwater can be used after primary sedimentation and secondary (biological) treatment to\ntake advantage of filtration and bio-degradation that occurs as the water passes\nthrough the upper soil layers and zone of aeration. On the other hand, if the water is to\nbe used for direct recharge, secondary treatment should be followed by chemical\nclarification (coagulation-flocculation-clarification). The water is then allowed to pass\nthrough adequate filter beds. The filtration is followed by tertiary treatment involving\nair tripping, granular activated carbon treatment, reverse osmosis and disinfection, in\nthat order.\nThe consideration of chemical quality of source water will thus lead to decis",
    "ry treatment involving\nair tripping, granular activated carbon treatment, reverse osmosis and disinfection, in\nthat order.\nThe consideration of chemical quality of source water will thus lead to decisions\nabout the extent and type of treatment required, arrangements for treatment plants and\nthe cost of source water. In case it is not possible to ensure the desired quality\nstandard from the treatment, such source(s) may be avoided for recharging the ground\nwater.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 41\n5. PLANNING OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE SCHEMES\nProper planning is essential for the successful outcome of any artificial recharge\nscheme. Planning of artificial recharge schemes involves the formulation of a suitable\nplan, under a given set of natural conditions, to augment the natural ground water\nrecharge. An artificial recharge scheme may be aimed at recharge augmentation in a\nspecific area for making up the shortage in ground water recharge compared to the\nground water draft either fully or partially.\nThe area involved in artificial recharge projects may range from a watershed, a\nlimited area covering an urban, rural or industrial centre or administrative units like\nMandal/Block to large basins or larger administrative units like Districts/States.\nThough the steps involved in planning are essentially the same, the planning is done\non different scales as per the required objectives and the area involved. Thus,\nplanning of recharge scheme may be done at Mega level (State or Basin level), Macro\nlevel (District or sub-basin level) and Micro level (Block or Watershed level) at\nprogressively larger scales. It is advisable to do State/Basin level planning at 1:\n2000,000 scale, District / Sub-basin level planning at 1:250,000 scale and Block /\nWatershed level planning at 1:50,000 scale and so on.\nProper scientific investigations aimed at assessing the need and feasibility of an area\nfor artificial recharge are necessary prerequi",

The most important considerations in this\nregard are described in brief in the following sections.\n5.1.1 Establishing the Need\nAssessing the need for recharge augmentation in a scientific and objective manner\nforms the first step in planning a recharge scheme.

In case where the\nground water deficit gets compounded due to overexploitation, artificial recharge\nmeasures will often have to be coupled with economy measures for preventing misuse\nof water and regulation of ground water development through legislation for them to\nbe effective.\nThe need for artificial recharge also requires to be prioritized according to its\nimportance in the overall development perspective of the nation. Such prioritization\nwill also help in deciding the economic viability of the scheme being contemplated.\nRecharge for catering to drinking water needs in adverse situations, preventive\nrecharge to combat saline water ingress/land subsidence and augmentation of water\nsupply to projects of strategic importance fall under the highest priority. A benefit\ncost ratio of 0.9: 1 or even less may be acceptable depending upon the conditions\nunder which the project is being implemented. Providing subsistence irrigation in\nsemi-arid and drought-prone areas comes under the next category where a benefit cost\nratio of 1 may be considered adequate. Recharge augmentation for industrial use and\nirrigation augmentation in humid areas have the least priority and a benefit cost ratio\nof 1.5:1 or higher may be required in such situations.\nIn cases where the objective of recharge is replenishment of de-saturated aquifer\nzones or to arrest/reverse decline in ground water levels, the benefit cannot be directly\nreflected in terms of BC ratio as the benefits are mostly intangible. In such cases, a\nlong-term declining trend of ground water levels, in the absence of significant\nnegative departure of rainfall, may be attributed to",
    "f BC ratio as the benefits are mostly intangible. In such cases, a\nlong-term declining trend of ground water levels, in the absence of significant\nnegative departure of rainfall, may be attributed to over-development of ground water\nresources. Data pertaining to a period of at least 10 years is recommended for\nexamining the trend of ground water levels in an area.\n5.1.2 Estimation of Sub-surface Storage Capacity of Aquifers\nThe scope for artificial recharge in an area is basically governed by the thickness of\nunsaturated material available above the water table in the unconfined aquifer. Depth\nto water level, therefore, provides the reference level to calculate the volume of\nunsaturated material available for recharge. Depth to water level recorded during post-\nmonsoon period is used for the purpose as areas where the natural recharge is not\nenough to compensate the ground water withdrawal, can be easily identified using the\nwater level data. The average water levels for a period of at least 5 years is to be used\nin order to nullify the effects of variation in rainfall.\nContour maps prepared from the average post-monsoon water level data with suitable\ncontour intervals can be used for assessment of available storage space. The inter-\ncontour areas between successive contours are determined and the total area in which\nthe water levels are below a certain cut-off level (say 3.00 m.bgl in phreatic aquifers),\nmultiplied by the specific yield of the aquifer material gives the volume of sub-\nsurface storage space available for recharge. The cut-off water level is so selected to\nensure that the recharge does not result in water logging conditions in the area.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 43\nAfter assessing the subsurface storage space, the actual requirement of source water is\nto be estimated.

To\narrive at the total volume of actual source water required at the surface, the volume of\nwater required for artificial recharge is calculated by multiplying the volume of sub-\nsurface storage space with the reciprocal of recharge efficiency of the structure\nproposed.\nSample worksheets for estimation of sub-surface storage capacity and volume of\nwater required for recharge is shown in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 respectively.\nTable 5.1 Sample Worksheet for Estimation of Sub-surface Storage Capacity\nSl.\nNo.\nBasin Water-\nshed\nGeographi-\ncal area\n(sq.km)\nArea\nidentified\nfor\nartificial\nrecharge\n(sq.km)\nDepth to\nwater\nlevel\n(Post-\nmonsoon)\nbelow\ncut-off\nlevel\n(m)\nVolume of\nunsaturated\nzone\n(M Cu m)\nAverage\nspecific\nyield\n(%)\nTotal\nsubsurface\nstorage\npotential as\nvolume of\nwater (M Cu\nm)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7= (5x6) 8 9=(7x8)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTable 5.2 Sample Worksheet for Estimation of Volume of Water Required for\nRecharge\nSl.\nNo\nBasin / Sub\nbasin /\nWatershed\nArea\nIdentified\nfor Artificial\nRecharge*\n(Sq.km)\nSub surface\nStorage\nPotential**\n(M Cu m)\nRecharge\nEfficiency\n(%)\nSurface Water\nRequirement\n(M Cu m)\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)=(4 )x 100 / (5)\n1\n2\n3\n*As in column 5 & ** column 9 of Table 5.1\n5.1.3 Prioritisation of Areas for Artificial Recharge\nIt may not always be possible to implement artificial recharge projects in the entire\narea even though the need is established, due to various constraints such as lack of\nsource water, shortage of funds for implementation of the projects etc. In such cases,\nit may be necessary to identify areas that require recharge augmentation most and to\nimplement recharge projects accordingly.\nPrioritisation of areas for artificial recharge is normally done by overlaying post-\nm o n s o o n d e p t h t o w a t e r l e v e l m a p s w i t h m",

From these maps, it is possible to demarcate areas with various\ncombinations of depth to water levels and water level trends. For example, if a depth\nto water level map having 3 m contour intervals is combined with a water level trend\nmap with 0.1 m/year contour interval, it is possible to demarcate areas having\na) water levels in the range of 3 to 6 m.bgl and declining trend of 0.10 to 0.20\nm/year.\nb) water levels deeper than 9.00 m bgl and declining trend in excess of 0.40\nm/year or\nc) water levels deeper than 12.00 m bgl, but with a long term rising trend of 0.2\nto 0.4 m/year.\nd) Water levels in the range of 5.0 to 10.0m with declining trends during both\npre-monsoon and post-monsoon season.\nNormally, areas having deeper water levels and declining water level trends are given\nhigher priority identification of area feasible for artificial recharge. Areas having\nshallow water levels / rising water level trends are not considered for inclusion in\nartificial recharge plan.\n5.1.4 Availability of Source Water\nA realistic assessment and quantificati on of the source water hel p design the storage\ncapacity of the structure.

The quality aspects of the water to be utilized for recharge needs to be\nascertained from the available data and if required through detailed analysis.\n5.1.5 Suitability of Area for Recharge\nThe climatic, topographic, soil, land-use and hydrogeologic conditions are important\nfactors controlling the suitability of an area for artificial recharge. The climatic\nconditions broadly determine the spatial and temporal availability of water for\nrecharge, whereas the topography controls the extent of run-off and retention. The\nprevalent soil and land use conditions determine the extent of infiltration, whereas the\nhydrogeologic conditions govern the occurrence of potential aquifer systems and their\nsuitability for artificial recharge.\n5.1.5.1 Climatic Conditions\nIn regions experiencing high (1000 to 2000 mm/year) to very high (>2000 mm/year)\nrainfall, such as the Konkan and Malabar coasts, North-eastern States, parts of lesser\nHimalayas in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, eastern part of Madhya Pradesh\na n d pa r ts of Bi h a r an d B en g al , a m aj or p a r t of th e w a te r r e c ei v e d d u ri n g th e r ai ny\ns e a s o n g o e s a s s u r f a c e r u n o f f .

    "ter available as possible in large surface\nreservoirs, to be  released to downstream areas during non-monsoon periods for direct\nuse or to be used as source water for artificial recharge in suitable areas. The second\nand third order streams in such regions may have flow throughout the winter and the\nmajor rivers are normally perennial.  The water in these streams and rivers, diverted,\nlifted or drawn through induced recharge may also be used as source water for\nartificial recharge.\nIn areas having moderate rainfall (750 – 1000 mm/year) such as eastern parts of\nPunjab and Maharashtra, eastern and central parts of Madhya Pradesh, parts of\nGodavari delta, eastern coast and Karnataka, adequate ground water resources are\ngenerally available only during the rainy season. A major component of the\nprecipitation goes as surface runoff in these areas too and recharge may be 10 to 15\npercent of annual precipitation. Ground water recharge is normally not sufficient to\nsaturate the water table aquifers in deficit rainfall years. The second and third order\nstreams normally do not have any flow during a major part of winter and only major\nstreams may have some flow during summer.\nThe non-availability of surplus runoff beyond the rainy season may impose a severe\nconstraint on artificial recharge to ground water in these areas. Diversion of water\nreleased from surface water reservoirs in the upper reaches of the catchments, water\ntransferred from surplus basins or lifted from rivers wherever available may be\nrequired for sustaining irrigation water supplies. Hence, conserving as much of\nsurface runoff as possible through watershed treatment measures, inducing additional\nrecharge during and after rainy season and conserving ground water outflow through\nsubsurface dykes may be suitable for such areas.\nIn semi-arid regions with low to moderate rainfall in the range of 400 to 700 mm/year,\nthe annual precipitation may not even suffice to meet the existing water demand, and\ndroughts may o",

The evapotranspiration losses in these areas are quite high and even\nthough 15 to 20 percent of water gets infiltrated into the ground, the total ground\nwater recharge will be limited because of the low rainfall. The stream flow in these\nregions is mostly restricted to the rainy season.\nThe replenishment of aquifers during rainy season generally is not enough to cater to\nthe irrigation requirements during Rabi season in such areas, though it may be\nadequate for drinking water use through winter. Shortage of drinking water supplies is\ncommon during summer, which may be acute in years of deficit rainfall. Though\nrecharge augmentation is warranted, due to lack of availability of source water, the\nonly option available is to conserve as much of the surplus surface runoff during the\nshort rainy season. Rainwater harvesting and runoff conservation measures for\naugmenting the ground water resources are appropriate in such situations.\nIn areas falling in arid zone, such as western Rajasthan desert, parts of Kutch region\nof Gujarat and Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, the annual precipitation is less\nthan 400 mm, the number of rainy days between 20 and 30 or even less and the\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 46\ncoefficient of variation of rainfall is normally between 30 and 70 percent.

Such areas may be left out of consideration\nfor artificial recharge in spite of need unless trans-basin water is available. Rainwater\nharvesting may be contemplated in such regions for augmenting drinking water\nsupplies. In case imported water is available, spreading or injection methods (for\nconfined aquifers) may be considered depending on surface conditions (sandy/rocky),\ntopographic set-up and salinity profiles of soils and the zone of aeration.\n5.1.5.2 Topographic Set-up\nThe topographic set-up of an area controls the retention period of surface and ground\nwater within a topographic unit. The gradients are very steep (more than 1:10) in the\nrunoff zones, with very little possibility of infiltration. Such areas on hill-slopes may\nbe suitable only for water conservation measures like gully plugging, bench terracing\nor contour trenching, aimed at slowing down surface runoff and thereby causing more\ninfiltration, which may go as delayed subsurface seepage either to the unconfined or\ndeeper confined aquifer systems.\nModerate topographic slopes between 1:10 and 1:100 usually occur on valley sides,\ndownward of piedmont foothill regions. Surface and subsurface retention of water in\nthese areas will be for longer durations depending upon slope and other conditions.\nThe piedmont zone, with characteristically deep water table is located immediately at\nthe foothills. The surface drainage is generally located above the water table. The se\nareas are suitable for locating recharge basins and percolation ponds for recharging\nthe water table aquifer.

    "itable for locating recharge basins and percolation ponds for recharging\nthe water table aquifer. These unconfined aquifers may or may not recharge the\ndeeper aquifers depending upon their hydraulic connectivity. At elevations just below\nthe piedmont zone, artificial recharge through percolation ponds, recharge pits,\ntrenches and recharge basins is normally feasible. In this transition zone, the\npiezometric heads of deeper aquifers may be initially located below the phreatic\nsurface but at lower elevations, the situation may be the reverse. In the former\nsituation, recharge of deeper aquifers through shafts, gravity inflow wells or injection\nwells may be feasible if sufficient source water supply is available.\nThe broad valley floors or the zone of lowest elevation occurring along the major\nrivers may typically have gentle to very gentle gradients. The movement of both\nsurface and ground water in these areas is sluggish and retention time, in general, is\nhigh. These areas are generally categorized as ground water storage zones as all the\nwater moving down the water table gradient converges in this zone. The deeper semi-\nconfined aquifers often contribute water to the unconfined zone through upward\nleakage due to higher piezometric heads. The need for artificial recharge in such areas\nm a y a r i s e o n l y w h e n t h e y a r e l o c a t e d i n l o w r a i n f a l l z o n e s o r h a v e a d v e r s e\nhydrogeologic conditions.

    "3 Soil and Land Use Conditions\nSoil and land use conditions are of vital importance if artificial recharge through\nsurface spreading methods is contemplated in an area. Various factors such as the\ndepth of soil profile, its texture, mineral composition and organic content control the\ninfiltration capacity of soils. Areas having a thin soil cover are easily drained and\np e rm i t m or e i n f i l tr a ti on wh en c om p a r e d to a r e a s wi th th i c k s oi l c ov e r i n th e v al l ey\nzones. Soils having coarser texture due to higher sand-silt fractions have markedly\nhigher infiltration capacity as compared to clay-rich soils, which are poorly\npermeable. Soils containing minerals, which swell on wetting like montmorillonite\netc. and with higher organic matter, are good retainers of moisture necessary for crop\ngrowth but impede deeper percolation.\nThe land use and extent of vegetation also controls the infiltration capacity of soils.\nB a r r e n v a l l e y s l o p e s a r e p o o r r e t a i n e r s o f w a t e r a s c o m p a r e d t o g r a s s l a n d s a n d\nforested tracts, which not only hold water on the surface longer, but also facilitate\nseepage during the rainy seasons through the root systems. Similarly, ploughed fields\nfacilitate more infiltration as compared to barren fields.\n5.1.5.4 Hydrogeological Factors\nHydrogeological conditions of the area are also among important factors in planning\nartificial recharge schemes. The recharged water moves below the soil zone in\nmoisture fronts through the zone of aeration. The unsaturated flow is governed by the\npermeability of zone of aeration, which in turn varies with moisture content of the\nf r o n t .

The hydrogeologic properties of the weathered strata are generally much better\nas compared to the parent rock due to higher porosity and permeability imparted by\nweathering.  The nature of soil, subsoil, weathered mantle, presence of hard pans or\nimpermeable layers govern the process of recharge into the unconfined aquifer. The\nsaturation and movement of ground water within unconfined and all deeper semi-\nconfined and confined aquifers is governed by storativity and hydraulic conductivity\nof the aquifer material. Aquifers best suited for artificial recharge are those, which\nabsorb large quantities of water and release them whenever required.\nThe geologic formations encountered in India have been classified into three groups\nbased on their hydrogeologic properties and ground water potential. The broad\nhydrogeological characteristics of each group and the suitability of artificial recharge\nmethods in each are given in Tables 5.3 .

    ".2 Investigations for Proper Planning\nVarious inputs are necessary for proper and scientific planning of artificial recharge\nschemes in any terrain. Scientific investigations leading to a better understanding of\nthe characteristics of sub-surface formations are to be taken up for realistic\ndetermination of these inputs. These can broadly be grouped into two categories\nnamely viz. general studies and detailed studies.\n5.2.1 General Studies\nThese studies are aimed at assessing the need and scope of artificial recharge in an\narea. The procedure to be followed for establishing the need for artificial recharge in\nan area to augment the ground water resources has already been described in detail in\nan earlier section of the chapter.\nOnce a case of overexploitation of ground water is proved, the need for augmentation\nof ground water resources through artificial recharge is justified. In case of entire\nwatersheds, overlaying of maps depicting the long-term decline in water levels and\ncumulative departure of rainfall from the normal can help in identification of areas\nrequiring recharge augmentation.\nOnce the areas requiring artificial recharge are identified, the next step is to decide on\nthe appropriate techniques for recharging the aquifer. The synthesis of all available\ndata relevant to ground water is the first step in this exercise. These data include a) all\nsources of recharge like rivers, tanks, canals etc., b) rainfall distribution pattern, c)\nhydrogeological parameters with emphasis on lithological characteristics, d) nature of\nthe terrain, e) intensity of ground water development and irrigation practices and f)\nchemical quality of surface and ground water etc. The data is generally available in\nreports/records of various Central and State Government agencies.

    "the data\navailable often have considerable gaps. It is therefore necessary to have detailed\nstudies to supplement the available data and for preparation of a scientific data base\nfor proper implementation of suitable artificial recharge schemes.\n5.2.2 Detailed Studies\nOnce the need for and suitability of the area for artificial recharge to ground water are\nidentified on the basis of data collected from the general studies, areas identified as\nsuitable for recharge augmentation are studied in detail using Remote Sensing\ntechniques and through hydrometeorological, hydrological, geophysical,\nhydrogeological and hydrochemical investigations to ascertain the scope and\nfeasibili ty of artificial recharge. These studi es are to be ori ented in such a way as to\ncollect and analyse necessary data, which are to be used as inputs for proper planning\nof artificial recharge projects. The major inputs expected to be provided by the studies\nmentioned are given below (Table 5.4)\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 53\nTable.5.4 Details of Studies Required for Planning Artificial Recharge Schemes\nSl.No Type of Study Inputs Anticipated\n1 Remote Sensing Studies\nSpatial variation in the infiltration\ncharacteristics of various litho-units.\nDrainage characteristics and Lineament\nintensity.\nDistribution of various geomorphic units.\n2 Hydrometeorological Studies Rainfall amount, duration, daily and hourly\nrainfall intensity, variability of rainfall.\n3 Hydrological Studies\nSource water availability, infiltration\ncharacteristics of major soil types and\nvarious land use categories\n4 Geophysical Studies\nThickness of weathered zone in hard rocks\nThickness and characteristics of granular\nzones in sedimentary terrain.\nStratification of aquifer system and spatial\nvariability in hydraulic conductivity.\nVertical hydraulic conductivity\nDiscontinuities such as dykes and fault\nzones.\n5 Hydrogeological Studies\nRegional hydrogeology and aquifer\ncharacteri",

Satellite data provides quick and useful baseline information\non various parameters controlling the occurrence and movement of ground water such\nas geology, structural features, geomorphology, soils, land use, land cover, lineaments\netc. All these parameters used to be studied earlier independently due to non-\navailability of data and lack of integrating tools and modeling techniques.

Aspects, which\nare given special attention for the study, usually carried out with Satellite Imagery or\nFalse Colour Composites (FCC) on 1: 50,000 scale include stream course delineation,\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 54\nland form analysis, outcrop pattern analysis, fracture pattern analysis and land use\nanalysis.

    "d form analysis, outcrop pattern analysis, fracture pattern analysis and land use\nanalysis. These studies can provide valuable information on drainage density and\nlineament intensity, which helps in the identification of suitable sites for recharge.\nVarious geomorphic units can also be delineated, which also help determine the type\nof recharge structures suitable for the area.\nApart from visual interpretation, digital image enhancement techniques are also being\nincreasingly used for deriving geological, structural and geomorphological\ninformation. Digital Image Enhancement techniques are found to be extremely useful\nas they improve the feature sharpness and contrast for simple interpretation. Various\nthematic layers generated using remote sensing data such as lithology, structure,\ngeomorphology, land use/land cover, lineaments etc. can be integrated with slope,\ndrainage density and other collateral data in a Geographic Information System (GIS)\nframework and analysed using a model developed with logical conditions to arrive at\nsuitable sites for artificial recharge.\nImage rectification and preparation of a GIS file through visual interpretation of\nstandard False Color Composite (FCC) data can be done to extract expressions of sub-\nsurface moisture conditions. Techniques such as Edge Enhancement are Band\nRationing are useful techniques for digital image interpretation.\nObservations from satellite data must be complemented by field checks, existing\ngeologic maps and topographic sheets.\n5.2.2.2 Hydrometeorological Studies\nRainfall and evaporation are two of the most important parameters, which are\nrequired for proper planning of artificial recharge schemes.\nDetailed information pertaining to the amount, duration and intensity of rainfall in a\ngiven area is a necessary pre-requisite for planning recharge schemes.

Rainfall data is\nnormally available at offices of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Revenue\nOffices such as Collectorates, Taluk/Block/Mandal offices, Irrigation project dam\nsites and Agricultural Universities/ Colleges etc.\nLong-term average rainfall is an important parameter for assessing the storage\ncapacity of various artificial recharge structures. On the other hand, daily and hourly\nrainfall data is essential for planning water conservation schemes such as farm ponds,\ncontour trenches, roof top rainwater harvesting schemes and also for designing filters\nfor runoff recharge schemes.\nLong-term average rainfall, dependable average rainfall and probability of incidence\nof a p a r ti c ul a r am ou n t of r ai n f al l i n a gi v en a r e a c a n b e c al c ul a te d u s i n g l on g - te rm\nrainfall data of IMD Stations for 100 to 150 years. For computations of daily and\nhourly rainfall intensity, data available with other agencies can be used.\nEvaporation data is useful for assessing the potential losses from the free surfaces of\nponds and other surface water storage structures. Data related to daily/seasonal/\nmonthly evaporation losses is helpful for identification of most effective recharge\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 55\nschemes in an area. The period/duration of ground water recharge with minimum\nevaporation losses can be determined from this data.\n5.2.2.3 Hydrological Studies\nHydrological investigations are useful for ascertaining the availability of source water\nfor recharge. These investigations are required to be carried out in the watershed, sub-\nbasin or basin where the artificial recharge schemes are envisaged.\nA detailed account of the hydrological investigations for artificial recharge schemes\nhave already been discussed under the heading ‘Source Water' earlier in the manual.\n5.2.2.4 Geophysical Studies\nGeophysical studies can provide useful informat",
    "igations for artificial recharge schemes\nhave already been discussed under the heading ‘Source Water' earlier in the manual.\n5.2.2.4 Geophysical Studies\nGeophysical studies can provide useful information pertaining to the characteristics of\nsub-surface lithological formations, which influence the type of recharge mechanism\nsuitable for a particular area. These studies are normally taken up to complement the\ndata collected through hydrogeological investigations.\nThe main purpose of applying geophysical methods for the selection of appropriate\nsites for artificial recharge studies is to assess the unknown sub-surface\nhydrogeological conditions economically, adequately and unambiguously. They are\nusually employed to narrow down the target zone and to pinpoint the probable sites\nfor artificial recharge structures. The application of geophysical techniques is also\nuseful for bringing out a comparative picture of the sub-surface litho-environment and\nto correlate them with the hydrogeological setting. Besides defining the sub-surface\nstructure and lithology, geophysical studies can also help in studies for identifying the\nbrackish/fresh ground water interface, contaminated zones (saline) and area prone to\nseawater intrusion.\nIn the context of artificial recharge, Geophysical studies are particularly useful for\ngathering information pertaining to\ni. Stratification of aquifer systems and spatial variability of hydraulic\nconductivity of different zones.\nii. Negative or non-productive zones of low hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated\nand saturated zones.\niii. Vertical hydraulic conductivity discontinuities such as dykes, faults etc.\niv. Moisture movement and infiltration.\nv. Direction of ground water flow under natural/artificial recharge processes.\nvi. Salinity changes in aquifers with depth / saline water ingress.\nSurface Geophysical techniques such as Electrical Resistivity Surveys, Self Potential\n( S P ) s u r v e y s , V e r y L o w F r e q u e n c y ( V L F ) E l e c t",

Physical parameters like rock resistivities, magnetic\nsusceptibilities, shock wave velocities etc. are measured in these investigations and\ninterpreted to gather information pertaining to sub-surface rock types, rock water\ncontent, structural controls on ground water movement and ground water salinity.\nSubsurface methods such as Spontaneous Potential, Neutron, Natural Gamma, and\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 56\nClosed Circuit Television (CCTV) logging techniques are also useful for collecting\nvaluable information from boreholes in the study area. As compared to surface\nmethods, which measure parameter values representative of a combined subsurface\nlayer sequence, subsurface methods measure the value of the physical parameter\nconcerned for each individual layer.\n5.2.2.5 Hydrogeological Studies\nA detailed understanding of the hydrogeology of the area is of prime importance in\nensuring successful implementation of any artificial recharge scheme. A desirable\nfirst step toward achieving this objective is to synthesize all available data on various\nhydrogeological parameters from different agencies. Regional geological maps\nindicate the location of different geological strata, their geological age sequence,\nboundaries/contacts of individual formations and structural expressions like strike,\ndip, faults, folds, fractures, intrusive bodies etc. These maps also indicate the\ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts.\nMaps providing information on regional hydrogeological units, their ground water\npotential and general pattern of ground water fl",
    "ate the\ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts.\nMaps providing information on regional hydrogeological units, their ground water\npotential and general pattern of ground water flow and chemical quality of ground\nwater in different aquifers are also necessary. Satellite imagery provide useful data on\ngeomorphic units and lineaments, which govern the occurrence and movement of\nground water, especially in hard rock terrain. A detailed hydrogeological study, aimed\nat supplementing the regional picture of hydrogeological set up available from\nprevious studies, is imperative to have precise information about the promising\nhydrogeological units for recharge and to decide on the location and type of structures\nto be constructed.\n5.2.2.5.1 Detailed Hydrogeological Mapping: The purpose of detailed\nhydrogeological mapping is to prepare the following maps, which facilitate an\nunderstanding of the ground water regime and its suitability to artificial recharge\nschemes\ni) Map showing the hydrogeological units demarcated on the basis of their\nwater-bearing capabilities, both at shallow and deep levels.\nii) Map showing ground water elevation contours to determine the form of\nthe water table and the hydraulic connection between ground water and\nsurface water bodies like rivers, tanks and canals.\niii) Maps showing depths to water table, usually compiled for the periods of\nmaximum, minimum and mean annual positions of water table.\niv) Maps showing amplitudes of ground water level fluctuation.\nv) M aps sh owi n g pi ezom etri c h eads of aquif ers an d th ei r vari ati ons wi th\ntime.\nvi) Maps showing ground water potentials of different hydrogeological\nunits and the levels of ground water development.\nvii) Maps showing chemical quality of ground water in different aquifers.\nThe usage of the above interpretative maps is additive, i.e., their combined usage\nprovides greater knowledge and understanding of an area than when a map is used in\nisolation.

For surface water spreading techniques, the area of interest is generally restricted\nto shallow depths. The main stress is on knowing whether the surface rock types are\nsufficiently permeable to maintain high rate of infiltration during artificial recharge.\n5.2.2.6 Hydrochemical Studies\nA detailed study of the quality of source water is vitally important whenever direct\nrecharge techniques are contemplated. In cases where  in situ  precipitation or water\nsupplied from canals are used for recharge, no constraints on account of water quality\nmay arise. However, in cases where waters in the lower reaches of rivers or recycled\nmunicipal/industrial waste waters are proposed to be used, the quality of water\nrequires to be precisely analysed and monitored to determine the type and extent of\ntreatment required.\n5.3 Appraisal of Economic Viability\nEconomic viability is another critical parameter to be ascertained before taking a\ndecision to implement any artificial recharge scheme.

The appraisal of economic\nviability has to be carried out after taking into account all possible expenses including\nthose for investigation, source water (conveyance, treatment), construction of\nrecharge structures, operation and maintenance etc. All benefits should be\nappropriately accounted for and assessed in order to decide the acceptability of the\nscheme as per its priority in the overall scheme of development.\nImportant guidelines for carrying out economic appraisal of ground water recharge\nprojects are furnished below:\ni. The inputs and outputs should be distinguished as ‘tradables’ and ‘non-\ntradables’.\nii. It is to be assumed that the project under consideration will not change the\nprice of the output.\niii. Certain adjustments have to be made for converting financial prices to\neconomic prices by applying appropriate conversion factors.\niv. The economic analysis should consider the effects of the project on both the\nproducer and the user.\nv. Labour and wages under skilled and unskilled categories have a special\nsignificance in the valuation for economic analysis. The real contribution to\nthe economy probably varies according to region, type of labour and season.\nHence, an extensive labour market survey is required for proper restructuring\nof the analysis.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 58\nvi. Although the computational part of the appraisal is rather straightforward, the\nessential purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the project has a positive\nimpact on the efficient application of the resources of the nation.\nvii.

If the project yields attractive returns to the Government but does not make a\ncontribution to the efficient use of national resources, additional policy\nmeasures may be required to rectify the situation.\nIt is important to carry out the benefit cost analysis for all major public works before\nd e ci di n g th e al l oc a ti on of f un ds .

Costs are related to\ninvestments occurring during the lifetime of the project. Benefits, on the other hand,\noriginate from the productive use of the projects. Both costs and benefits are,\ntherefore, expressed in quantitative terms and translated into monetary terms by using\nmarket values of the inputs and outputs concerned. As the costs and benefits occur at\ndifferent points of time, it is customary to express both in terms of their present value\nby applying appropriate discounting factors to make them comparable. After\naccounting for both costs and benefits against their market values, appropriate criteria\nare applied to determine the profitability of the project.\nThe benefit cost analysis of projects, also called Project Appraisal is done before the\ndecision is taken to invest.

ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE TECHNIQUES AND DESIGNS\nThe selection of a suitable technique for artificial recharge of ground water depends\non various factors. They include:\na) Quantum of non-committed surface run-off available.\nb) Rainfall pattern\n         c)   Land use and vegetation\nc) Topography and terrain profile\nd) Soil type and soil depth\ne) Thickness of weathered / granular zones\nf)   Hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics\ng)   Socio-economic conditions and infrastructural facilities available\nh)   Environmental and ecological impacts of artificial recharge scheme\nproposed.\n6.1 Artificial Recharge Techniques\nTechniques used for artificial recharge to ground water broadly fall under the\nfollowing categories\nI) Direct Methods\nA) Surface Spreading Techniques\na) Flooding\nb) Ditch and Furrows\nc) Recharge Basins\nd) Runoff Conservation Structures\ni) Bench Terracing\nii) Contour Bunds and Contour Trenches\niii) Gully Plugs, Nalah Bunds, Check Dams\niv) Percolation Ponds\ne) Stream Modification / Augmentation\nB) Sub-surface Techniques\na) Injection Wells (Recharge Wells)\nb) Gravity Head Recharge Wells\nc)   Recharge Pits and Shafts\nII) Indirect Methods\nA) Induced Recharge from Surface Water Sources;\nB) Aquifer Modification\ni) Bore Blasting.\nii) Hydro-fracturing.\nIII) Combination Methods\nIn addition to the above, ground water conservation structures like Subsurface dykes\n(Bandharas) and Fracture Sealing Cementation techniques are also used to arrest\nsubsurface flows.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 61\nAquifer disposition plays a deci",

The downward movement of water is governed by a host of factors\nincluding vertical permeability of the soil, presence of grass or entrapped air in the\nsoil zone and the presence or absence of limiting layers of low vertical permeability at\ndepth. Changes brought about by physical, chemical and bacteriological influences\nduring the process of infiltration are also important in this regard.\nImportant considerations in the selection of sites for artificial recharge through\nsurface spreading techniques include\ni) The area should have gently sloping land without gullies or ridges.\nii) The aquifer being recharged should be unconfined, permeable and\nsufficiently thick to provide storage space.\niii) The surface soil should be permeable and have high infiltration rate.\niv) Vadose zone should be permeable and free from clay lenses.\nv) Ground water levels in the phreatic zone should be deep enough to\naccommodate the recharged water so that there is no water logging.\nvi) The aquifer material should have moderate hydraulic conductivity so\nthat the recharged water is retained for sufficiently long periods in the\naquifer and can be used when needed.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water",
    "hat the recharged water is retained for sufficiently long periods in the\naquifer and can be used when needed.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 62\nThe most common surface spreading techniques used for artificial recharge to ground\nwater are flooding, ditch and furrows and recharge basins.\n6.2.1.1 Flooding\nThis technique is ideal for lands adjoining rivers or irrigation canals in which water\nlevels remain deep even after monsoons and where sufficient non-committed surface\nwater supplies are available. The schematics of a typical flooding system are shown in\nFig.6.2. To ensure proper contact time and water spread, embankments are provided\non two sides to guide the unutilized surface water to a return canal to carry the excess\nwater to the stream or canal.\nFlooding method helps reduce the evaporation losses from the surface water system,\nis the least expensive of all artificial recharge methods available and has very low\nmaintenance costs\n6.2.1.2 Ditch and Furrows method\nThis method involves construction of shallow, flat-bottomed and closely spaced\nditches or furrows to provide maximum water contact area for recharge from source\nstream or canal. The ditches should have adequate slope to maintain flow velocity and\nminimum deposition of sediments. The widths of the ditches are typically in the range\nof 0.30 to 1.80 m. A collecting channel to convey the excess water back to the source\nstream or canal should also be provided. A typical system is shown in Fig. 6.3(a) and\nthree common patterns viz. lateral ditch pattern, dendritic pattern and contour pattern\nare shown in Fig.6.3 (b). Though this technique involves less soil preparation when\ncompared to recharge basins and is less sensitive to silting, the water contact area\nseldom exceeds 10 percent of the total recharge area.\nFig.6.2 Schematics of a Typical Flood Recharge System\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 6",

They can also be constructed parallel to canals or surface water sources. In\nalluvial areas, multiple recharge basins can be constructed parallel to the streams\n(Fig.6.4), with a view to a) increase the water contact time, b) reduce suspended\nmaterial as water flows from one basin to another and c) to facilitate periodic\nmaintenance such as scraping of silt etc. to restore the infiltration rates by bypassing\nthe basin under restoration.\nFig 6.4 Schematics of a Typical Recharge Basin\nIn addition to the general design guidelines mentioned, other factors to be considered\nwhile constructing recharge basins include\na) area selected for recharge should have gentle ground slope.\nb) the entry and exit points for water should be diagonally opposite to\nfacilitate adequate water circulation in individual basins,\nc) water released into the basins should be as sediment – free as possible and\nd)  rate of inflow into the basin should be slightly more than the infiltration\ncapacity of all the basins.\n6.2.2 Runoff Conservation Structures\nThese are normally multi-purpose measures, mutually complementary and conducive\nto soil and water conservation, afforestation and increased agricultural productivity.\nThey are suitable in areas receiving low to moderate rainfall mostly during a single\nmonsoon season and having little or no scope for tran",

It helps in\nsoil conservation and holding runoff water on the terraced area for longer durations,\nleading to increased infiltration and ground water recharge.\nFor implementing terracing, a map of the watershed should be prepared by level\nsurveying and suitable benchmarks fixed. A contour map of 0.3 m contour interval is\nthen prepared. Depending on the land slope, the width of individual terrace should be\ndetermined, which, in no case, should be less than 12 m. The upland slope between\ntwo terraces should not be more than 1:10 and the terraces should be leveled. The\nvertical elevation difference and width of terraces are controlled by the land slope.\nThe soil and weathered rock thickness required, vertical elevation difference and the\ndistance between the bunds of two terraces for different slope categories are furnished\nin Table.6.1.\nIn cases where there is a possibility of diverting surface runoff from local drainage for\nirrigation, as required in case of paddy cultivation in high rainfall areas, outlet\nchannels of adequate dimensions are to be provided.

    "oil moisture storage involve construction of small embankments or bunds across the\nslope of the land. They derive their names from the construction of bunds along\ncontours of equal land elevation.

Elevation contours, preferably of 0.3 m interval\nare then drawn, leaving out areas not requiring bunding such as habitations, drainage\netc. The alignment of bunds should then be marked on the map.\nThe important design aspects of contour bunds are i) spacing, ii) cross section and iii)\ndeviation freedom to go higher or lower than the contour bund elevation for better\nalignment on undulating land.\n6.2.2.2.1 Spacing of Bunds: Spacing of contour bund is commonly expressed in terms\nof vertical interval (V.I), which is defined as the difference in elevation between two\nsimilar points on two consecutive bunds. The main criterion for spacing of bunds is to\nintercept the water before it attains the erosive velocity. Spacing depends on slope, soil,\nrainfall, cropping pattern and conservation practices.\nSpacing of contour bunds is normally calculated using the formula\nVertica",
    "before it attains the erosive velocity. Spacing depends on slope, soil,\nrainfall, cropping pattern and conservation practices.\nSpacing of contour bunds is normally calculated using the formula\nVertical Interval (V.I) = 0.305 (XS+Y),  where\nX is the rainfall factor,\nS  is the land slope (%) and\nY is the factor based on soil infiltration and crop cover during the\nerosive period of rains\nThe rainfall factor ‘X’ is taken as 0.80 for scanty rainfall regions with annual rainfall\nbelow 625 mm, as 0.60 for moderate rainfall regions with annual rainfall in the range\nof 625 to 875 mm and as 0.40 for areas receiving annual rainfall in excess of 875 mm.\nTh e f actor ‘ Y’ i s taken as 1.0 f or s oi l s h avi ng poor i nfil trati on wi th l ow crop c ov er\nduring erosive rains and as 2.0 for soils of medium to good infiltration and good crop\ncover during erosive rains. When only one of these factors is favourable, the value of\nY is taken as 1.50. Vertical spacing can be increased by 10 percent or 15 cm to\nprovide better location, alignment or to avoid obstacles.\nThe horizontal interval between two bunds is calculated using the formula\nHorizontal Interval (H.I) = V.I x 100/Slope\n6.2.2.2.2 Cross Section of Contour Bunds: A trapezoidal cross section is usually\nadopted for the bund. The design of the cross section involves determination of height,\ntop width, side slopes and bottom width of the bund.\nThe height of the bund depends on the slope of the land, spacing of the bunds and the\nrainfall excess expected in 24-hour period for 10-year frequency in the area. Once the\nheight is determined, other dimensions can be worked out depending on the nature of\nthe soil.\nHeight of the bund can be determined by the following methods\na) Arbitrary Design: The depth of impounding is designed as 30 cm. 30 cm is\nprovided as depth flow over the crust of the outlet weir and 20 cm is\nprovided as free board.

Side slopes of the bund are dependent on the angle of repose of the soil in\nthe area and commonly range from 1:1 for clayey soils to 2:1 for sandy soils. Base\nwidth of the bund depends on the hydraulic gradient of the water in the bund\nmaterial due to the impounding water. A general value of hydraulic gradient\nadopted is 4:1. The base should be sufficiently wide so that the seepage line should\nnot appear above the toe on the downstream side of the bund.\nSize of the bund is expressed in terms of its cross-sectional area. The cross sectional\narea of bunds depends on the soil type and rainfall and may vary from 0.50 to 1.0 sq\nm in different regions.

The area of cross-section of side and lateral bunds is taken equal to the\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 69\nmain contour bund. The product of cross sectional area of the bund and the bunding\nintensity gives the quantity of earthwork required for bunding / hectare of land.\n6.2.2.2.3  Deviation Freedom: Strict adherence to contours while constructing bunds\nis a necessary prerequisite for ensuring maximum conservation of moisture and soil.\nHowever, to avoid excessive curvature of bunds, which makes agricultural operations\ndifficult, the following deviations are permitted\na) a maximum of 15 cm while cutting across a narrow ridge,\nb) a maximum of 30 cm while crossing a gully or depression and\nc) a maximum of 1.5 m while crossing a sharp, narrow depression not\nexceeding 5 m in width.\n6.2.2.3 Contour Trenches\nContour trenches are rainwater harvesting structures, which can be constructed on hill\nslopes as well as on degraded and barren waste lands in both high- and low- rainfall\nareas. Cross section of a typical contour trench is shown in Fig.6.6.\nFig.6.6 Schematics of a Contour Trench\nThe trenches break the slope at intervals and reduce the velocity of surface runoff.\nThe water retained in the trench will help in conserving the soil moisture and ground\nwater recharge.\nThe size of the contour trench depends on the soil depth and normally",

The size and number of trenches are worked out on\nthe basis of the rainfall proposed to be retained in the trenches. The trenches may be\ncontinuous or interrupted and should be constructed along the contours. Continuous\ntrenches are used for moisture conservation in low rainfall area whereas intermittent\ntrenches are preferred in high rainfall area.\nThe horizontal and vertical intervals between the trenches depend on rainfall, slope\nand soil depth. In steeply sloping areas, the horizontal distance between the two\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 70\ntrenches will be less compared to gently sloping areas. In areas where soil cover is\nthin, depth of trenching is restricted and more trenches at closer intervals need to be\nconstructed. In general, the horizontal interval may vary from 10 m in steep slopes to\nabout 25 m in gentle slopes.\n6.2.2.4 Gully Plugs, Nalah Bunds and Check Dams\nThese structures are constructed across gullies, nalahs or streams to check the flow of\ns u r f a c e w a t e r i n t h e s t r e a m c h a n n e l a n d t o r e t a i n w a t e r f o r l o n g e r d u r a t i o n s i n t h e\npervious soil or rock surface. As compared to gully plugs, which are normally\nconstructed across 1 st order streams, nalah bunds and check dams are constructed\nacross bigger streams and in areas having gentler slopes. These may be temporary\nstructures such as brush wood dams, loose / dry stone masonry check dams, Gabion\ncheck dams and woven wire dams constructed with locally available material or\npermanent structures constructed using stones, brick and cement.

Competent civil and\nagro-engineering techniques are to be used in the design, layout and construction of\npermanent check dams to ensure proper storage and adequate outflow of surplus water\nto avoid scours on the downstream side for long-term stability of the dam.\nThe site selected for check dam should have sufficient thickness of permeable soils or\nweathered material to facilitate recharge of stored water within a short span of time.\nThe water stored in these structures is mostly confined to the stream course and the\nheight is normally less than 2 m. These are designed based on stream width and\nexcess water is allowed to flow over the wall. In order to avoid scouring from excess\nrunoff, water cushions are provided on the downstream side. To harness maximum\nrunoff in the stream, a series of such check dams can be constructed to have recharge\no n a r e g i o n a l s c a l e . T h e d e s i g n p a r t i c u l a r s o f a c e m e n tnalah bund are shown in\nFig.6.7.\nThe following parameters should be kept in mind while selecting sites for check dams\n/ nalah bunds:\ni) The total catchment area of the stream should normally be between\n40 and 100 ha. Local situations can, however, be a guiding factor in\nthis regard.\nii) The rainfall in the catchment should be preferably less than 1000\nmm / annum.\niii) The stream bed should be 5 to 15 m wide and at least 1m deep.\niv) The soil downstream of the bund should not be prone to water\nlogging and should have a pH value between 6.5 and 8.\nv) The area downstream of the Check Dam / bund should have\nirrigable land under well irrigation.\nvi) The Check dams / Nalah bunds should preferably be located in\nareas where contour or graded bunding of lands have been carried\nout.\nvii) The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately\npermeable to cause ground water recharge.\nCheck dams / Nalah bunds are normally 10 to 15 m long, 1 to 3 m wide and",
    "een carried\nout.\nvii) The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately\npermeable to cause ground water recharge.\nCheck dams / Nalah bunds are normally 10 to 15 m long, 1 to 3 m wide and 2 to 3 m\nhigh, generally constructed in a trapezoidal form. Detailed studies are to be made in\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 71\nthe watershed prior to construction of the check dam to assess the current erosion\ncondition, land use and water balance. The community in the watershed should also\nbe involved in the planning and selection of the type and location of the structure.\nFor construction of the check dam, a trench, about 0.6 m wide in hard rock and l.2 m\nwide in soft impervious rock is dug for the foundation of core wall. A core brick\ncement wall, 0.6 m wide and raised at least 2.5m above the nalah bed is erected and\nthe remaining portion of trench back filled on upstream side by impervious clay. The\ncore wall is buttressed on both sides by a bund made up of local clays and stone\npitching is done on the upstream face. If the bedrock is highly fractured, cement\ngrouting is done to make the foundation leakage free.\n6.2.2.5  Percolation Tanks\nPercolation tanks, which are based on principles similar to those of nalah bunds, are\namong the most common runoff harvesting structures in India.  A percolation tank can\nbe defined as an artificially created surface water body submerging a highly\npermeable land area so that the surface runoff is made to percolate and recharge the\nground water storage. They differ from nalah bunds in having larger reservoir areas.\nThey are not provided with sluices or outlets for discharging water from the tank for\nirrigation or other purposes. They may, however, be provided with arrangements for\nspilling away the surplus water that may enter the tank so as to avoid over-topping of\nthe tank bund.\nIt is possible to have more than one percolation tank in a catchment if sufficient\nsurplus ru",
    "for\nspilling away the surplus water that may enter the tank so as to avoid over-topping of\nthe tank bund.\nIt is possible to have more than one percolation tank in a catchment if sufficient\nsurplus runoff is available and the site characteristics favour artificial recharge\nthrough such structures. In such situations, each tank of the group takes a share in the\nyield of the whole catchment above it, which can be classified as\n(i)  'free catchment', which is the catchment area that only drains into the tank\nunder  consideration and\n(ii) 'combined catchment', which is the area of the whole catchment above the\ntank.\nT h e d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n t h e c o m b i n e d a n d f r e e c a t c h m e n t g i v e s t h e a r e a o f t h e\ncatchment intercepted by the tanks located upstream of any tank. The whole\ncatchment of the highest tank on each drainage shall be its free catchment.  Moreover,\neach tank will receive the whole runoff from its free catchment, but from the\nremainder of its catchment it will receive only the balance runoff that remains after\nthe upper tanks have been filled.\n6.2.2.5.1  Site Selection Criteria: The important site selection criteria for percolation\nponds include\ni) The hydrogeology of the area should be such that the litho-units occurring\nin the area of submergence of the tank should have high permeability. The\nsoils in the catchment area of the tank should be sandy to avoid silting up\nof the tank bed.\nii) The availability of non-committed surplus monsoon runoff should be\nsufficient to ensure filling of the tank every year.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 72\niii) As the yield of catchments in low rainfall areas generally varies between\n0.44 to 0.55 M Cu m/sq km, the catchment area may be between 2.50 and\n4.0 sq km for small tanks and between 5.0 and 8.0 sq km for larger tanks.\niv) Selection of the size of a percolation tank should be governed by the\npercolation capacity of the st",
    "y be between 2.50 and\n4.0 sq km for small tanks and between 5.0 and 8.0 sq km for larger tanks.\niv) Selection of the size of a percolation tank should be governed by the\npercolation capacity of the strata rather than the yield of the catchment. In\norder to avoid wastage of water through evaporation, larger capacity tanks\nshould be constructed only if percolation capacity is proven to be good. If\npercolation rates are low to moderate, tanks of smaller capacity may be\nconstructed. Percolation tanks are normally designed for storage capacities\nof 8 to 20 M cft. (2.26 to 5.66 M Cu m).\nv) The depth of water impounded in the tank provides the recharge head and\nhence it is necessary to design the tank to provide a minimum height of\npon ded water col um n of 3 to 4.5 m an d rarel y 6 m ab ov e th e b ed l evel .\nThis would imply construction of tanks of large capacity in areas with\nsteep gradient.\nvi) The purpose of construction of percolation tanks is to ensure recharge of\nmaximum possible surface water runoff to the aquifer in as short a period\nas possible without much evaporation losses. Normally, a percolation tank\nshould not retain water beyond February.\nvii) The percolation tank should be located downstream of runoff zone,\npreferably toward the edge of piedmont zone or in the upper part of the\ntransition zone. Land slope between 3 and 5 percent is ideal for\nconstruction of percolation tanks.\nviii) There should be adequate area suitable for irrigation and sufficient number\nof ground water abstraction structures within the command of the\npercolation tank to fully utilise the additional recharge. The area benefited\nshould have a productive phreatic aquifer with lateral continuity up to the\npercolation tank. The depth to water level in the area should remain more\nthan 3 m below ground level during post-monsoon period.\n6.2.2.5.2  Investigations Required: An area, preferably the entire watershed, needing\nadditional ground water recharge is identified on the basis of declini",

Survey of India\ntoposheets, aerial photographs and satellite imagery of the area may be consulted to\ngather preliminary information about the area under study.  The nature of catchment\nas regards to the general slope, land use, forest cover, cropping pattern, soils, geology\netc. should be understood to assess their influence on runoff.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 73\nFig.6. 7 Design Aspects of a Cement Nalah Bund\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 74\nThe rainfall data of rain gauge stations located in the watershed or in its immediate\nvicinity is to be collected during the preliminary investigations.  The intensity and\npattern of rainfall, number of rainy days and duration of dry spells during the\nmonsoon are to be analyzed.  The dependability of normal monsoon rainfall and the\ndeparture of actual rainfall from normal rainfall are also worked out along with other\nweather parameters.\nPercolation tanks are to be normally constructed on second or third order streams, as\nthe catchment area of such streams would be of optimum size.

    "the catchment area of such streams would be of optimum size. The location of tank\nand its submergence area should be in non-cultivable land and in natural depressions\nrequiring lesser land acquisition.  There should be cultivable land down stream of the\ntank in its command with a number of wells to ensure maximum benefit by such\nefforts. Steps should be taken to prevent severe soil erosion through appropriate soil\nconservation measures in the catchment. This will keep the tank free from siltation\nwhich otherwise reduces the percolation efficiency and life of the structure.\nDetailed geological and hydrogeological mapping is to be carried out in the area of\nsubmergence, at the tank site and also downstream of the site to find out the\npermeability of vadose zone and aquifer.

Aquifer parameters of\nwater-bearing formations in the zone of influence may also be determined to assess\nthe recharge potential and number of feasible ground water structures in the area.\nPeriodic water level measurements along with ground water sampling for water\nquality may be done before and after the construction of percolation tanks. Detailed\ngeological investigations may be carried out to study the nature and depth of\nformation at the bund (dam) site for deciding the appropriate depth of cut off trench\n(COT). This will help in reducing the visible seepage and also ensure safety and long\nlife of the structure.

It should be designed with maximum capacity utilisation,\nlong life span, cost-effectiveness and optimum recharge to ground water in mind.\nStorage capacity, waste weir, drainage arrangements and cut off trench (COT) are the\nimportant features of percolation tank that need proper design.  The overall design of\nthe percolation tank is similar to that of an earthen dam constructed for minor\nirrigation.\nDetailed topographical survey to demarcate the area of submergence in natural\ndepression and alignment of dam line in the valley is to be taken up prior to\nconstruction of the structure. A number of sections along and across the drainage are\nprepared and the best suitable site is identified.  The land availability and possibility\nof land acquisition is explored during the survey. The spillway site is demarcated and\nis designed in such a way that it allows the flow of surplus water based on single day\nmaximum rainfall after the tank is filled to its maximum capacity. The depth of\nfoundation for masonry work of waste weir etc. is decided depending on the nature of\nformation. Cut Off Trench (COT) is provided to minimize the seepage losses across\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 75\nthe streambed.  The depth of COT is generally 2-6 m below ground level depending\nupon the subsurface strata. In order to avoid erosion of bund due to ripple action,\nstone pitching is provided in the upstream direction up to High Flood Level (HFL).\nThe sources for availability of constructional material, especially clay and porous soil\nfor earthwork and stone rubble for pitching are to be identified.\na) Design of Storage Capacity: Th e s torage cap aci ty of a percol ati on tan k m ay be\ndef i ned as th e",

The total capacity of the tank will be the sum of the capacities\nbetween successive contours. The smaller the contour interval, the more accurate the\ncapacity computation will be. The summation of all the volumes between successive\ncontours will be required for computing the storage capacity of the tank. When\ncontour plan is not available and only the area of the tank at FTL is known, then the\neffective volume of the tank may be roughly computed as the area multiplied by one-\nthird of the depth from FTL to the deep bed of the tank.\nThe tank is designed to ensure maximum utilisation of its capacity.  A structure of\noptimum capacity is the most cost effective. An under-utilized structure leads to\nunproductive expenditure incurred on extra earthwork.  The design of storage capacity\nof a tank depends mainly upon the proper estimation of catchment yield, which is\ncalculated as,\nQ = A * Strange's Coefficient\nWhere, Q is yield at site and A is area of the catchment.\nStrange's coefficients for various amounts of monsoon rainfall for three categories of\ncatchments, i.e. good, average and bad are available from Strange's tables provided in\nstandard Hydrology text books. The rainfall data of 40-50 years, collected from the\nnearest rain gauge station, may be used for design purposes.

For inferior soils or greater\ndepths, however, the riveted slope may be made flatter, say 2:1.\nIn this way, for average cases, a 1.5:1 slope will generally be adopted for upstream\nface and 2:1 slope for downstream face.\nThis practice is contrary to the standard recommendations adopted in many countries\nwhere the upstream slope, even when riveted, is kept flatter than the downstream\nslope because of the soil being saturated. There are, however, thousands of tanks in\nTamil Nadu with slopes of 1.5:1 and failure by slipping of this slope is rare. Hence,\nthe prevailing practice can be easily adopted. In very small tanks and in cases where\nthe upstream slope is heavily riveted, upstream faces have been given 1:1 or even\nsteeper slopes in actual practice, but such steeper slopes are not recommended.\nc) Waste/ Surplus Weir: The waste/surplus weirs are constructed for discharging the\nexcess water from the tank into the downstream channel after it is filled so as to avoid\nthe rise of water in the tank above the Maximum Water Level (MWL).

Upstream Revetment of Tank Bunds\nAlthough the effective storage capacity of a percolation tank is limited by FTL, the\narea submerged by the tank bund and revetment is dependent on MWL. Hence, in\norder to restrict the dimensions of these, it is desirable to keep the difference between\nFTL and MWL as small as possible. On the other hand, the smaller the difference, the\nlonger will be the surplus escape required in order to enable it to pass the given\ndischarge. Hence, the difference (H) between FTL and MWL is fixed on a\ncompromise basis in each particular project so as to obtain maximum economy and\nefficiency. In small and medium sized tanks, the usual difference between FTL and\nMWL is kept between 0.30 and 0.60 m and is rarely allowed to exceed 0.90 m.\nS u r p l u s w e i r s a r e s i m i l a r t o r i v e r w e i r s ( i . e .

The shutters can be dropped down during floods\nso as to reduce the afflux (the rise in the Maximum Flood Level (HFL) upstream\nof the weir caused due to the construction of the weir) by increasing the\nwaterway opening. This type of weir is particularly suitable for hard clay and\nconsolidated gravel foundations.

For this, the channel is so modified that the flow gets spread over a wider area,\nresulting in increased contact with the streambed. The methods commonly used\ninclude a) widening, leveling, scarifying or construction of ditches in the stream\nchannel, b) construction of L – shaped finger levees or hook levees in the river bed at\nthe end of high stream flow season and c) Low head check dams which allow flood\nwaters to pass over them safely.\nStream channel modification can be employed in areas having influent streams that\nare mostly located in piedmont regions and areas with deep water table such as arid\nand semi arid regions and in valley fill deposits. The structures constructed for stream\nchannel modification are generally temporary, are designed to augment ground water\nrecharge seasonally and are likely to be destroyed by floods. These methods are\ncommonly applied in alluvial areas, but can also be gainfully used in hard rock areas\nwhere thin river alluvium overlies good phreatic aquifers or the rocks are extensively\nweathered or fractured in and around the stream channel. Artificial recharge through\nstream channel modifications could be made more effective if surface storage dams\nexist upstream of the recharge sites as they facilitate controlled release of water.\n6.2.3.

    "e Techniques\nSubsurface techniques aim at recharging deeper aquifers that are overlain by\nimpermeable layers, preventing the infiltration from surface sources to recharge them\nunder natural conditions. The most common methods used for recharging such deeper\naquifers are a) Injection wells or recharge wells, b) Recharge pits and shafts, c) Dug\nwell recharge, d) Borehole flooding and e) Recharge through natural openings and\ncavities.\n6.2.3.1 Injection Wells or Recharge Wells\nI n j e c t i o n w e l l s o r r e c h a r g e w e l l s a r e s t r u c t u r e s s i m i l a r t o b o r e / t u b e w e l l s b u t\nconstructed for augmenting the ground water storage in deeper aquifers through\nsupply of water either under gravity or under pressure. The aquifer to be replenished\nis generally one with considerable desaturation due to overexploitation of ground\nwater. Artificial recharge of aquifers by injection wells can also be done in coastal\nregions to arrest the ingress of seawater and to combat problems of land subsidence in\nareas where confined aquifers are heavily pumped.\nIn alluvial areas, injection wells recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can\nbe constructed in a manner similar to normal gravel packed pumping wells. However,\nin case of recharge wells, cement sealing of the upper section of the wells is done to\nprevent the injection pressure from causing leakage of water through the annular\nspace of the borehole and the well assembly. Schematics of a typical injection well in\nalluvial terrain are shown in Fig.6.12.  I n h a r d r o c k a r e a s , i n j e c t i o n w e l l s m a y n o t\nrequire casing pipes and screens and an injection pipe with an opening against the\nfractures to be recharged may be sufficient.

    "echarge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 86\nwells with slotted pipes against the zones to be recharged may be required for\nrecharging multiple aquifer zones separated by impervious rocks.\nThe effectiveness of recharge through injection wells is limited by the physical\ncharacteristics of the aquifers. Attempts to augment recharge may prove to be\ncounter-productive in cases where the aquifer material gets eroded due to the speed of\nground water flow, especially in unconsolidated or semi-consolidated aquifers.\nFailure of confining layers may also occur if excessive pressure is applied while\ninjecting water. These may result in clogging and/or even collapse of the bore/tube\nwell.\n6.2.3.1.1 Site Selection and Design Criteria\ni) A proper understanding of the aquifer geometry is the most important\nfactor in implementation of successful recharge schemes through\ninjection or recharge wells. Detailed studies of the vertical and lateral\nextents of the aquifer and its characteristics are necessary prerequisites\nfor such schemes. Grain size distribution of granular aquifers is\nanother important parameter in the case of sedimentary aquifers.\nii) Recharge through injection wells increases chances of clogging of well\nscreens and aquifer material, resulting in decreased injection rates.\nClogging may be caused by suspended particles and air bubbles in the\nsource water, formation of chemical precipitates in the well, source\nwater or aquifer material, proliferation of bacteria in and around the\ninjection well and swelling and dispersion of clay in the aquifer being\nrecharged. Clogging may be minimized by proper treatment and\nremoval of suspended material from source water, chemical\nstabilization and bacterial control. Using non-corrosive materials for\npipelines and well casings may minimize clogging by corrosion\nproducts. Chlorination of source water prevents development of\nbacterial growth.

    "pelines and well casings may minimize clogging by corrosion\nproducts. Chlorination of source water prevents development of\nbacterial growth. Acid treatment helps in removing calcium carbonate\nprecipitates from the gravel packs and aquifers. Periodic development\nof wells through surging, swabbing and pumping can considerably\nimprove the efficiency and life of injection wells.\niii) As clogging increases the well losses considerably, the efficiency of\ninjection wells should be taken as 40 to 60 percent as compared to\npumping wells of similar design in the same situation.\niv) Adequate care should be taken to ensure that the water being used for\nrecharge is not contaminated. The water being recharged should be\ncompatible with the formation water to avoid any precipitation and\nresultant clogging. The relative temperatures of source and formation\nwaters also affect the recharge rate.\nv) For optimum benefits, it is advisable to have injection – cum –\npumping wells to be used both for ground water recharge and\nextraction under favourable conditions.\nvi) The following considerations are important in the design of an\ninjection well\na) The permissible pressure head of hydraulic injection in terms of\nwater column may be worked out as 1.2 times the depth to the top\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 87\nof the confined aquifer, which represent the hydrofracturing\npressure of the confining layer. In consolidated strata, however,\nthis pressure is likely to be much higher.

They do not necessarily\npenetrate or reach the unconfined aquifers like gravity head recharge wells and the\nrecharging water has to infiltrate through the vadose zone.\n6.2.3.3.1 Recharge Pits: Recharge pits are normally excavated pits, which are\nsufficiently deep to penetrate the low-permeability layers overlying the unconfined\naquifers ( Fig.6.14). They are similar to recharge basins in principle, with the only\ndifference being that they are deeper and have restricted bottom area.

Abandoned gravel quarry\npits or brick kiln quarry pits in alluvial areas and abandoned quarries in basaltic areas\ncan also be used as recharge pits wherever they are underlain by permeable horizons.\nNalah trench is a special case of recharge pit dug across a streambed. Ideal sites for\nsuch trenches are influent stretches of streams. Contour trenches, which have been\ndescribed earlier also belongs to this category.\n6.2.3.3.1.1 Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines\ni) The recharging capacity of the pit increase with its area of cross section.\nHence, it is always advisable to construct as large a pit as possible.\nii) The permeability of the underlying strata should be ascertained through\ninfiltration tests before taking up construction of recharge pits.\niii) The side slopes of recharge pits should be 2:1 as steep slopes reduce\nclogging and sedimentation on the walls of the pit.\niv) Recharge pits may be used as ponds for storage and infiltration of water or\nthey may be back-filled with gravel sand filter material over a layer of\ncobbles/boulders at the bottom. Even when the pits are to be used as ponds,\nit is desirable to provide a thin layer of sand at the bottom to prevent the silt\nfrom clogging permeable strata.\nv) As i n th e cas e of water s preadi ng techni ques , th e s ource water b ei n g us ed\nfor recharge should be as silt-free as possible.\nvi) The bottom area of the open pits and the top sand layer of filter-packed pits\nmay require periodic cleaning to ensure proper recharge. Recharge pits\nlocated in flood-prone areas and on streambeds are likely to be effective for\nshort duration only due to heavy silting.

Further, they are much smaller\nin cross section when compared to recharge pits. Detailed design particulars of a\nrecharge shaft are shown in Fig.6.16\n6.2.3.3.2.1 Design Guidelines\ni) Recharge shafts may be dug manually in non-caving strata. For construction\nof deeper shafts, drilling by direct rotary or reverse circulation may be\nrequired.\nii) The shafts may be about 2m in diameter at the bottom if manually dug. In\ncase of drilled shafts, the diameter may not exceed 1m.\niii) The shaft should reach the permeable strata by penetrating the overlying low\npermeable layer, but need not necessarily touch the water table.\niv) Unlined shafts may be back-filled with an inverse filter, comprising\nboulders/cobbles at the bottom, followed by gravel and sand. The upper\nsand layer may be replaced periodically. Shafts getting clogged due to biotic\ngrowth are difficult to be revitalized and may have to be abandoned.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 93\nFig.6.15 Schematics of Recharge Shafts\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 94\nFig.6.16 Design Particulars of a Typical Recharge Shaft\nv) Deeper shafts constructed in caving strata may require lining or casing.

The most common methods in this category are induced recharge from surface\nwater sources and aquifer modification techniques.\n6.3.1 Induced Recharge\nInduced recharge involves pumping water from an aquifer, which is hydraulically\nconnected with surface water to induce recharge to the ground water reservoir. Once\nhydraulic connection gets established by the interception of the cone of depression\nand the river recharge boundary, the surface water sources starts providing part of the\npumping yield ( Fig.6.17). Induced recharge, under favorable hydrogeological\nconditions, can be used for improving the quality of surface water resources due to its\npassage through the aquifer material. Collector wells and infiltration galleries, used\nfor obtaining very large water supplies from riverbeds, lakebeds and waterlogged\nareas also function on the principle of induced recharge.\nFig.6.17 Principle of Induced Recharge through Pumping of Wells near a Stream\na) Natural Flow Pattern b) Change in Flow Pattern Due to Pumping.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 95\nIn hard rock areas, abandoned buried channels often provide favorable sites for the\nconstruction of structures for induced recharge.

    "channels often provide favorable sites for the\nconstruction of structures for induced recharge. Check dams constructed in the river\nchannel upstream of the channel bifurcation can help in high infiltration to the\nchannel when wells located in the channels are pumped with high discharge for\nprolonged periods.\n6.3.1.1 Design Guidelines\ni) Quality of source water, hydraulic characteristics and thickness of aquifer\nm a t e r i a l , d i s t a n c e o f t h e p u m p i n g w e l l s f r om t h e r i v e r a n d t h e i r p u m p i n g\nrates are the important factors controlling the design of schemes for induced\nrecharge.\nii) For implementation of successful induced recharge schemes from stream\nchannels, pumping wells should be selected at sites where water in the\nstreams has sufficient velocity to prevent silt deposition.\niii) Dredging of channel bottom in the vicinity of the existing pumping wells\nmay have to be carried our periodically to remove organic matter and\nimpervious fine material from the beds of the channel.\niv) For wells constructed in unconfined alluvial strata for induced recharge, the\nlower one-third of the wells may be screened to have optimum drawdowns.\nIn highly fractured consolidated rocks, dug wells penetrating the entire\nthickness of the aquifer should be constructed with lining above the water\ntable zone and the curbing height well above the High Flow Level (HFL) of\nthe stream.\n6.3.2 Aquifer Modification Techniques\nThese techniques modify the aquifer characteristics to increase its capacity to store\nand transmit water through artificial means. The most important techniques under this\ncategory are bore blasting techniques and hydrofracturing techniques. Though they\nare yield augmentation techniques rather than artificial recharge structures, they are\nalso being considered as artificial recharge structures owing to the resultant increase\nin the storage of ground water in the aquifers.\n6.4 Combination Methods\nVarious combinations of surface and sub-su",

The selection of methods to be combined in such cases is\nsite-specific. Commonly adopted combination methods include a) recharge basins\nwith shafts, percolation ponds with recharge pits or shafts and induced recharge with\nwells tapping multiple aquifers permitting water to flow from upper to lower aquifer\nzones through the annular space between the walls and casing (connector wells) etc.\n6.5 Ground Water Conservation Techniques\nGround water conservation techniques are intended to retain the ground water for\nlonger periods in the basin/watershed by arresting the sub-surface flow. The known\ntechniques of ground water conservation are a) Ground water dams / sub-surface\ndykes / Underground ‘Bandharas’ and b) Fracture sealing Cementation techniques.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 96\n6.5.1 Sub-Surface Dykes / Ground Water Dams / Underground ‘Bandharas’\nA sub-surface dyke / ground water dam is a sub-surface barrier constructed across a\nstream channel for arresting/retarding the ground water flow and increase the ground\nwater storage. At favorable locations, such dams can also be constructed not only\nacross streams, but in large areas of the valley as well for conserving ground water.\nSchematics of a typical sub-surface dyke are shown in Fig.6.18\n6.5.1.1 Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines\ni) T h e p r i m a r y o b j e c ti v e o f a s u b - s u r f a c e d y k e i s t h e c r e a ti o n o f a s u b s u r f a c e\nstorage reservoir with suitable recharge conditions and low seepage losses.\nValley shapes and gradients are important considerations for site\nidentification.\nii) O",

This reduces the cost of the structure and makes it possible to\nhave a comparatively large storage volume. This implies that the gradient of\nthe valley floor should not be steep since that would reduce the storage\nvolumes behind a dam of given height.\niii) The limitations on depth of underground construction deem that the\nunconfined aquifer should be within a shallow to moderate depth (down to 10\nm bgl) and has a well-defined impermeable base layer.  Such situations occur\nin hard rock areas and shallow alluvial riverine deposits.\nFig.6.18 Schematics of a Subsurface Dyke in Basaltic Terrain.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 97\niv) The dyke is ideally constructed across narrow ground water valleys, generally\nn ot ex ceedi n g 150 to 200 m i n wi dth . On th e basi s of a th or ough s tudy of a\nwater table contour map of the area, a narrow ground water valley section\nwhere the flow lines tend to converge from up-gradient direction, usually\ncoinciding with a surface drainage line should be identified. The requirement\nof narrow flow section is usually fulfilled in watersheds in hard rock terrain\nhaving rolling topography where relatively narrow depressions separate hard\nrock spurs.\nv) The drainage valley across which the subsurface dyke is constructed should\ncarry a seasonal stream that goes dry in winter and summer and the water table\nshould be located well below the riverbed, preferably throughout the year (The\nstream should be preferably influent or may be effluent for a very limited\nperiod during rainy season). The valley section should preferably have a\nmoderate gradient (less than 1%) so that the benefit spreads sufficie",
    "preferably influent or may be effluent for a very limited\nperiod during rainy season). The valley section should preferably have a\nmoderate gradient (less than 1%) so that the benefit spreads sufficiently in the\nup-gradient direction.\nvi) The thickness of aquifer underlying the site should be adequate (more than 5\nm) so that the quantity of ground water stored is commensurate with the effort\nand investment. Normally, in hard rock watersheds, the drainage courses have\na limited thickness of alluvial deposits underlain by a weathered rock or\nfractured aquifer, which in turn passes into consolidated unaltered aquitard.\nThis forms an ideal situation.\nvii) The sub-surface dyke directly benefits the up-gradient area and hence should\nbe located at a sufficient distance below the storage zone and areas benefiting\nfrom such recharge. This implies construction of ground water conservation\nstructures in lower parts of the catchments but sufficiently upstream of\nwatershed outlet.\nviii) A sub-surface dyke may potentially deprive the downstream users the benefit\nof ground water seepage, which they received under a natural flow regime.\nCare should therefore be taken to see that a large number of users are not\nlocated immediately downstream and those affected are duly compensated\nthrough sharing of benefits. Care should also be taken to ensure that the water\nlevels in the upstream side of the dyke are deep enough not to cause any water\nlogging as a result of the dyke.\nix) For construction of ground water dam/ sub-surface dykes, a trench should be\ndug out across the ground water depression (streambed) from one bank to the\nother. In case of hilly terrain in hard rocks, the length of the trench generally\nmay be less than 50 m.  In more open terrain, the length may be usually less\nthan 200 m but occasionally even more. It should be wide enough at the\nbottom to provide space for construction activity. In   case of shallow trenches\ndown to 5 m depth, the width at the bottom should be 2 m",

In\ncase of hard rock terrain, below a limited thickness of alluvial fill, weathered\nzone and underlying fractured aquifer may occur. The trench should be deep\nenough to penetrate both highly weathered and fractured strata. In case of\nmore open terrain in consolidated or semi-consolidated strata, the alluvial\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 98\nthickness may be larger and the trench should end below the alluvial fill\ndeposit. In order to minimize or avoid problem of dewatering during\nconstruction, the work should be taken up by the end of winter and completed\nwell before the onset of rains, as water table is at lower elevation in this\nperiod.\nxi) The cut-out dyke could be either of stone or brick masonry or an impermeable\nclay barrier.

In case good impermeable clay is not available, a stone masonry\nwall of 0.45 metre thickness or a brick wall of 0.25 m thickness may be\nconstructed on a bed of concrete.  Cement mortar of 1: 5 proportion and\ncement pointing on both faces is considered adequate. In the case of very long\ntrenches, for economic considerations, it may be necessary to provide masonry\nwall only in the central part of dyke and clay dyke suitably augmented by tar\nfelting, PVC sheet etc. on the sides.\nxii) In case of clay dykes, the width should be between 1.5 and 2m depending on\nthe quality of clay used. The construction should be in layers and each fresh\nlayer should be watered and compacted by plain sheet or sheep foot rollers of\n1 to 2 ton capacity. In absence of roller, the clay should be manually\ncompacted by hand ramets. Where the core wall is a masonry structure, the\nremaining open trench should be back-filled by impermeable clay. The\nunderground structures should be keyed into both the flanks of stream for one\nmeter length to prevent leakage from sides.\nxiii) The top of the underground structures should be located between 1 to 1.5 m\nbelow the streambed to permit overflow in high water table stage for flushing\nof salinity of ground water stored behind the dyke. The alignment of the dyke\nshould be shown by fixing marker stones on the banks and whenever there is\nchange of alignment in between. Before back-filling the sub-surface trench,\npiezometric tubes should be installed on both the faces of the dyke for\nmeasuring water levels. Such piezometers should be located in the central part,\nand in case of wider dykes at additional one or two locations.\nxiv) Sites for construction of subsurface dykes have to be located in areas where\nthere is a great scarcity of water during the summer months or where there is\nneed for additional water for irrigation.

Some emphasis also needs to be laid\non finding sites where land ownership conditions would make constructions\nmore feasible. Single ownership is ideal in the absence of which it has to be\nimplemented on a cooperative basis.\n6.6. Suitability of Artificial Recharge Structures under Combinations of Factors\nBased on the discussions regarding various artificial recharge methods and structures,\nan attempt has been made to prescribe structures suitable for different slope\ncategories, aquifer types and amount of precipitation received.\nA matrix (Table 6.7) has been developed for easy visualization of these combinations\nand their possible variations. Three broad columns represent three distinct\nhydrogeologic settings normally encountered in nature.  Each of these columns is split\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 99\nfurther to represent areas based on the adequacy of rainfall received.  Areas receiving\nannual precipitation of less than 1000 mm and not having access to any surface inflow\nsource are taken as areas with limited source water availability.\nFour different slope categories have been considered in the matrix, representing\nrunoff zone, piedmont zone, transition zone and storage zone.  Indirectly, this\nclassification also takes into account the status of ground water flow in the aquifer.\nWithin each row the upper box represents the unconfined aquifers and the lower one\nrepresents for the leaky confined and confined aquifers.\nThe matrix thus tries to separate out 48 different combinations, all of which may not\nbe relevant or suitable for effecting artificial recharge.

    "Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 102\n7. ROOF TOP RAINWATER HARVESTING\nDrinking water supply in urban areas is mostly from surface sources like natural or\nimpounded reservoirs and from ground water sources. As the population density and\nusage levels are comparatively high in urban areas, Government agencies construct,\noperate and maintain huge surface water dams and reservoirs for meeting their water\ndemands. These sources are planned and constructed to take care of the water\nrequirements of the population throughout the year. Ground water is in use in areas\nwhere the surface water supplies are either not reaching or are not adequate.\nIn most of the rural areas, ground water is the major source of drinking water. In\nearlier days, open wells and ponds that belonged to the community were the source of\ndrinking water supply. With the advent of bore well technology and progress made in\nrural electrification, the scenario of rural water supply has considerably changed. The\ntraditional methods and practices have given way to hand pumps and power pump\nschemes. Government organisations have given priority to provide protected water\nsupply to the villages through rural water supply schemes. Bore wells are drilled and\nwater from over-head tanks is distributed through supply mains.  Statistics reveal that\nmore than 85% of rural water supply is from the ground water sources at present.\nIndiscriminate exploitation of ground water and the decline in ground water levels\nhave rendered many bore wells dry either seasonally or through out the year. To\novercome such a situation, bore wells and tube wells are now being drilled to greater\ndepths, often tapping ground water from deep aquifers hitherto considered ‘static’.\nDischarge of untreated effluents into surface water streams and lakes by industries has\nresulted not only in contaminating the surface water resources, but also the ground\nwater bodies.

In coastal areas, over exploitation of ground water has resulted in\nseawater intrusion, rendering ground water sources saline in some areas.\nIdentification and promotion of simple, reliable and environmental friendly\ntechnologies for augmentation of ground water resources are necessary to overcome\nthe above problems and to ensure the long-term sustainability of our precious ground\nwater resources.  Reviving the traditional practices of rainwater harvesting along\nscientific lines can go a long way in preventing a serious water crisis in the major part\nof our country in the years to come.\n7.1 Concept of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nThe concept of rainwater harvesting involves ‘tapping the rainwater where it falls’. A\nmaj or porti on of rainwater that f alls on the earth’s surface runs off into stream s and\nrivers and finally into the sea. An average of 8-12 percent of the total rainfall recharge\nonly is considered to recharge the aquifers. The technique of rainwater harvesting\ninvolves collecting the rain from localized catchment surfaces such as roofs, plain /\nsloping surfaces etc., either for direct use or to augment the ground water resources\ndepending on local conditions.  Construction of small barriers across small streams to\ncheck and store the running water also can be considered as water harvesting.\nAmong various techniques of water harvesting, harvesting water from roof tops needs\nspecial attention because of the following advantages:\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 103\na) Roof top rainwater harvesting is one of the appropriate options for augmenting\nground water recharge/ storage in urban areas where natural recharge is\nconsiderably reduced due to increased urban activities and not much land is\navailable for implementing any other artificial recharge measure.

Roof top\nrainwater harvesting can supplement the domestic requirements in rural areas as\nwell.\nb) Rainwater runoff which otherwise flows through sewers and storm drains and is\nwasted, can be harvested and utilized.\nc) Rainwater is bacteriologically safe, free from organic matter and is soft in nature.\nd) It helps in reducing the frequent drainage congestion and flooding during heavy\nrains in urban areas where availability of open surfaces is limited and surface\nrunoff is quite high.\ne) It improves the quality of ground water through dilution.\nf) The harnessed rainwater can be utilized at the time of need.\ng) The structures required for harvesting rainwater are simple, economical and eco-\nfriendly.\nh) Roof catchments are relatively cleaner and free from contamination compared to\nthe ground level catchments.\ni) Losses from roof catchments are much less when compared to other catchments.\nCollection of rainwater from roof tops for domestic needs is popular in some parts of\nI n d i a .

The water thus\ncollected can meet the immediate domestic needs. Tanks made of iron sheets, cement\nor bricks can also be used for storing water. In this method, water is collected from\nroofs using drain pipes/gutters fixed to roof edge.\nT h o u g h t h e p r a c ti c e o f r o o f t o p r a i n w a t e r h a r v e s t i n g i s a n a g e - ol d o n e , s y s t e m a ti c\ncollection and storage of water to meet the drinking water needs has become popular\nonly recently.

The popularity of this practice is limited by the costs involved in\ncollection of water by gutters/pipes and its storage in underground tanks made of iron\nor brick.  Use of Ferro-cement technology in construction and maintenance of storage\ntanks has become popular in recent years as the strength and durability of ferro-\ncement structures have been found to make the schemes cost-effective.\nRainwater harvesting practices vary widely in size, type of construction material used\nand methods of collection and storage.  Easy availability of know-how on systematic\nand economic methods of construction will encourage the user households to adopt\nthis practice.  There is also a need for creating awareness and for development of\nsimple techniques of construction/fabrication of the components of rainwater\nharvesting system for popularising this technique as a potential alternative source of\ndrinking water, at least for part of the year.\n7.2 Components of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting System\nIn a typical domestic roof top rainwater harvesting system, rainwater from the roof is\ncollected in a storage vessel or tank for use during periods of scarcity. Such systems\nare usually designed to support the drinking and cooking needs of the family and\ncomprise a roof, a storage tank and guttering to transport the water from the roof to\nt h e s t o r a g e t a n k .

Therefore, a typical Roof top Rainwater Harvesting System ( Fig.7.1)\ncomprises following components:\n Roof catchment.\n Drain pipes\n Gutters\n Down pipe\n First flush pipe.\n Filter unit\n Storage tank.\n Collection sump.\n Pump unit\nFig.",

B ri ef d es c ri p ti on s of e a ch of th e c om p on en ts a r e\ngiven below:\n7.2.1 Roof Catchment\nThe roof of the house is used as the catchment for collecting the rainwater.  The style,\nconstruction and material of the roof determine its suitability as a catchment.  Roofs\nmade of corrugated iron sheet, asbestos sheet, tiles or concrete can be utilized as such\nfor harvesting rainwater.  Thatched roofs, on the other hand, are not suitable as pieces\nof roof material may be carried by water and may also impart some colour to water.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 105\n7.2.2 Drain Pipes\nT h e d r a i n p i p e s o f s u i t a b l e s i z e , m a d e o f P V C / S t o n e w a r e a r e p r o v i d e d i n R C C\nbuildings to drain off the roof top water to the storm drains. They are provided as per\nthe building code requirements.\n7.2.3 Gutters\nGutters are channels fixed to the edges of roof all around to collect and transport the\nrainwater from the roof to the storage tank.  Gutters can be prepared in rectangular\nshapes (Fig.7.2) and semi-circular (Fig.7.3).\nFig. 7.2 Rectangular Gutter        Fig. 7.3 Semi-circular Gutter\nGutters are channels made of either plain Galvanized Iron sheets or cut PVC pipes or\nsplit Bamboo.  These channels are fixed to the roof ends to divert the rainwater into\nthe storage tank.  Semi-circular or rectangu",
    "nnels made of either plain Galvanized Iron sheets or cut PVC pipes or\nsplit Bamboo.  These channels are fixed to the roof ends to divert the rainwater into\nthe storage tank.  Semi-circular or rectangular shaped channels can be made using GI\nsheet.  Cut PVC pipes and Bamboos will be semi-circular in shape.  These channels\nare made at the site of construction and fixed to the roof by using mild steel supports.\nAs the preparation of gutters from GI sheet involves cutting and bending the sheet to\nth e r e q u i r e d s i z e an d s h a p e , c e r ta i n am oun t of s ki l l i s r e q ui re d .  G u t te r s f r om P V C\npipes or bamboos are easily made. Use of locally available materials reduces the\noverall cost of the system.\n7.2.4 Down Pipe\nDown pipe is the pipe that carries the rainwater from the gutters to the storage tank.\nDown pipe is joined with the gutters at one end, whereas the other end is connected to\nthe fil ter uni t of the storage tank as shown bel ow ( Fig.7.4).  PVC or GI pi pes of 50\nmm to 75 mm (2 inch to 3 inch) diameter are commonly used for down pipe. In the\ncase of RCC buildings, drain pipes themselves serve as down pipes. They have to be\nconnected to a pipe to carry water to the storage tank.\nThe down pipe and first flush pipe can be of either GI or PVC material of diameter\n7.5 cm.  Joining of pipes will be easy if both are of same material.\n\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 106\nFig. 7.4 Down Pipe\nT h e or i en ta ti on an d a r r a n gem en t of th e d ow n pi p e d e p en d s on r el a ti v e l oc a ti on s of\ntank and roof.

This\ncauses contamination of water collected in the storage tank, rendering it unfit for\ndrinking and cooking purposes.\nA first flush system can be incorporated in the roof top rainwater harvesting systems\nto dispose off the ‘first flush’ water so that is does not enter the tank.  There are two\nsuch simple systems.  One is based on a simple, manually operated arrangement,\nwhereby the down pipe is moved away from the tank inlet and replaced again once\nthe first flush water has been disposed. In another semi-automatic system, a separate\nvertical pipe is fixed to the down pipe with a valve provided below the ‘T’ junction\n(Fig.7.6).\n\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 107\nFig.7.6 First Flush Pipe\nAfter the first rain is washed out through first flush pipe, the valve is closed to allow\nthe water to enter the down pipe and reach the storage tank.\n7.2.6 Filtration of Water\n7.2.6.1 Process of Filtration\nF i l tr a ti on f orm s th e m os t i m p or ta n t p r oc e s s i n th e p u ri f i c a ti on of wa te r .  I t u s u al ly\ninvolves allowing water to pass through a filter media e.g. sand.  Filtration essentially\ninvolves removal of suspended and colloidal impurities present in water. Depending\non the type of filtration, the chemical characteristics of water may be altered and the\nbacterial content may be considerably reduced. These effects take place due to various\nprocesses such as mechanical straining, sedimentation, biological metabolism and\nelectrolytic changes.\nMechanical straining involves removal of suspended particles, which are unable to\npass through the voids of the filter media. Sedimentation of particles of impurities\noccurs in the voids between sand grains in the filter unit. S",
    "s removal of suspended particles, which are unable to\npass through the voids of the filter media. Sedimentation of particles of impurities\noccurs in the voids between sand grains in the filter unit. Such particles also adhere to\nthe sand grains due to i) presence of a gelatinous film or coating developed on sand\ngrains by previously trapped bacteria and colloidal matter and ii) physical attraction\nbetween particles. Biological metabolism in filter units involves the formation of a\nzoological jelly or film containing large colonies of bacteria around the sand grains,\nwhich feed on the organic impurities in the water and convert them into harmless\ncompounds by complex biochemical reactions. Electrolytic changes involve the\nneutralization of ionic charges of particles of suspended and dissolved impurities\nwhen they come into contact with sand particles having opposite charge. When this\nh a p p e n s , t h e y n e u t r a l i z e e a c h o t h e r , w h i c h u l t i m a t e l y r e s u l t s i n t h e a l t e r a t i o n o f\nchemical characteristics of water.\n7.2.6.2 Filter Sand\nThe sand being used for filter in roof top rainwater harvesting systems should be free\nfrom clay, loam, vegetable matter, organic impurities etc. and should also be uniform\nin nature and grain size. In place of sand, ‘anthrafilt’, made from anthracite (stone-\ncoal) can also be used as filter medium. This material is found to possess many\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 108\nadvantages such as low cost, high rate of infiltration and better efficiency. However,\nas sand is readily available almost everywhere, the usual practice is to use it as filter\nmedium.\n7.2.6.3 Classification of Filters\nFilters are classified into two main categories viz. Slow sand filters and Rapid sand\nfilters based on the rate of filtration. They have also been categorised as gravity filters\nand pressure filters depending on the forces aiding the process of filtration. Based on\nth",
    "rs and Rapid sand\nfilters based on the rate of filtration. They have also been categorised as gravity filters\nand pressure filters depending on the forces aiding the process of filtration. Based on\nthese, filters can be classified into i) Slow Sand Filters, ii) Rapid Sand Filters (gravity\ntype) and iii) Pressure Filters.\ni) Slow Sand Filters\nA t y p i c a l s l o w s a n d f i l t e r (Fig.7.7 & 7.8 ) c o n s i s t s o f a n e n c l o s u r e t a n k , u n d e r -\ndrainage system, base material, filter media (sand) and appurtenances.\nFig.7.7 Plan of a Slow Sand Filter\nOne of the major disadvantages of a slow sand filter is the requirement of\nconsiderable space for its installation. This makes it uneconomical for places where\nland is not available, or it is costly. This has led engineers and scientists to find out\nmeans for increasing the rate of filtration. It is observed that rate of filtration can be\nincreased either by increasing the grain size of sand used as filter media so that\nfrictional resistance to water passing through it is reduced, or by allowing water to\npass under pressure through the filter media.\nii. Rapid Sand Filters (Gravity type)\nRapid sand filters have been developed to achieve increased filtration rates by\nincreasing the grain size of the filter media. These types of filters are preferred for\nrainwater harvesting schemes implemented over larger areas\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 109\nFig.7.8 Cross section of a Slow Sand Filter\nEssential Parts\nThe layout of a typical rapid sand filter (gravity type) is shown in Fig. 7.9.\nFig. 7.9 Lay out of a Typical Rapid Sand Filter\nThe essential parts are the same as those of the slow sand filter, viz. Enclosure tank,\nUnder-drainage system, Base material, Filter media (sand) and appurtenances.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 110\nEnclosure Tank: A watertight tank, either of masonry or concrete is used.

The sides\nand floor are coated with waterproof material. Depth of the tank is about 2.50 to 3.0\nm. The surface area of a unit of rapid sand filter varies from 10 to 50 m2. The units are\narranged in series.\nUnder-Drainage System: There are various types of under-drainage systems, most of\nwhich are patented by the manufacturers. Two of the common types of under-\ndrainage systems are Perforated Pipe Systems and Pipe and Strainer Systems.\nIn a Perforated Pipe System, a number of lateral drains are attached to a central drain\nor manifold ( Fig. 7.10). The drains are usually made of cast iron. The lateral drains\na r e p l a c e d a t d i s t a n c e s o f 1 5 t o 3 0 c m . T h e y a r e a l s o p r o v i d e d w i t h h o l e s a t t h e\nbottom in such a way that the holes are at 30° with the vertical ( Fig. 7.11). The holes\nare about 10 mm in diameter and are sometimes staggered on either side instead of\nbeing continuous. The holes are usually drilled with a centre to centre distance of 75\nto 200 mm. Brass bushings are sometimes inserted in the holes to prevent rusting of\nsurface of holes. Concrete blocks, 40 to 50 mm thick, are placed on the floor of the\nfilter for supporting lateral drains.\nPerforated Pipe Systems are economical and simple in operation. They, however,\nrequire large quantities of about 700 litres of wash water per square metre of filter\narea for washing purpose. The wash water for this ‘high velocity wash’ is provided\nfrom a wash water overhead tank as shown in Fig. 7.9.\nPi p e an d S tr a i n e r Sy s tem s al s o h av e a cen tr a l d rai n or m an i f ol d wi th l a te r al d r ai ns\nattached on either side ( Fig.7.12).

A strainer (Fig.7.13) is a small pipe\nof brass, closed at the top and having perforations on its surface. They are either\ns c r e w e d or f i x e d on th e l a te r al d r ai n s . I n s om e ca s e s , th e s tr a i n e r s a r e f i x e d on th e\ncentral drain as well. Two lateral drains / strainers are normally placed at a distance of\n15 cm from each other.  It is desirable to place all the strainers at the same elevation.\nFig.7.10 Plan of Under-drainage System in a Rapid Sand Filter\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 111\nFig.7.11 Plan of a Perforated Lateral Drain\nIn Pipe and Strainer Systems, compressed air is used for cleaning the filter, which\nresults in saving of wash water. It still requires about 250 litres of wash water per\nminute per square metre of filter area for washing purpose. This process of washing is\nknown as ‘low velocity wash’.\nFig.7.12 Cross Section of Pipe and Strainer System\nFig. 7.13 Cross Section of a Strainer\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 112\nUnder-Drainage System: The under-drainage system in Pipe and Strainer Systems\nare designed in such a way that the ratio of length of lateral drain to its diameter does\nnot exceed 20 and the cross-sectional area of the central drain is about twice the cross-\nsectional area of the lateral drains. Care should be taken to ensure that the total cross-\nsectional area of the perforations is about 0.20 percent of the total filter area and the\ncross-sectional area of a lateral is about two to four times the total cross-sectional area\nof the perforations in it.\nBase Material: Gravel is used as the base material, which is placed on the top of the\nunder-drainage system. The gravel being used should be clean and free from clay,\ndust, silt and organic matter and should be durable, hard,",
    "sed as the base material, which is placed on the top of the\nunder-drainage system. The gravel being used should be clean and free from clay,\ndust, silt and organic matter and should be durable, hard, round and strong. The\nthickness of the layer of base material varies from 45 to 60 cm. It is usually graded\nand laid in layers of 15 cm. The size of the gravel increases from top to bottom.\nFilter Media (Sand): A layer of coarse sand, ranging in thickness from 60 to 90 cm\nis placed above the gravel. The effective size of sand used varies from 0.35 to 0.60\nmm and its uniformity coefficient is between 1.20 and 1.70, ensuring increased rate of\nfiltration on account of the increase in the void space between particles when\ncompared to slow sand filters.\nAppurtenances: In addition to the usual appurtenances required in the case of slow\nsand filters, the following special devices are to be provided in case of rapid sand\nfilters:\ni) Air Compressors: The agitation of sand grains during washing of filters is\nachieved by compressed air, water jet or mechanical rakes. When compressed\nair is to be used, an air compressor of suitable capacity should be installed.\nGenerally, it should have the capacity of supplying compressed air at the rate\nof 0.60 to 0.80 m3 per minute per square metre of filter area for 5 minutes. The\npressure of compressed air should be sufficient to overcome frictional\nresistance in air pipes and water above the air distribution system. The\ncompressed air may be supplied through laterals or through a dedicated pipe\nsystem.\nii) Wash water Troughs:  The water used for washing the filters is collected\nin wash water toughs or gutters, which are placed above sand bed level. The\ntroughs may be of cast-iron, concrete, steel or wrought iron. They are placed at\na distance of 130 to 180 cm from edge to edge. The bottom of the trough is\nabout 45 to 75 cm above the sand bed. For efficient working, the troughs\nshould be large enough and should be laid at a suitable slope.\niii",

For efficient working, the troughs\nshould be large enough and should be laid at a suitable slope.\niii) Rate Control Devices:  There are various devices to control the rate of\nflow of water, which may be fitted at the outlet of the filter. They work on the\nprinciple of Venturi meter.\nCleaning of Filters: When water passes through the filter, there is head loss due to\nfrictional resistance. The difference in water levels in the filter and in the outlet pipe\nprovides an idea about the loss of head (Fig. 7.14). When the filter is clean, the head\nl o s s i s n e g l i g i b l e ( a b o u t 1 5 t o 3 0 c m ) . I t g o e s o n i n c r e a s i n g w i t h t i m e u n t i l t h e\nfrictional resistance offered by the filter media exceeds the static head of water above\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 113\nthe sand bed, due to the deposition of suspended matter in the top layer. The lower\npart of the filter media then acts more or less like a vacuum and water is sucked\nthrough the filter media rather than getting filtered by passing through it. The fall of\nliquid level in the piezometric tubes below the centre line of the under-drainage\nsystem indicates negative head. The negative head thus formed tends to release\ndissolved air and other gases present in the water, which sticks to the sand grains,\nseriously impairing the functioning of the filter. In case of rapid sand filters, the\npermissible loss of head is about 3.0 to 3.5 m and the permissible negative head is\nabout 120 cm. The filter is to be cleaned when this limit is reached.\nFig. 7.14 Loss of Head and Negative Head\nOperational Problems: The most commonly encountered operational problems of\nrapid sand filters are i) Mud balls and ii) Cracking of filters.\ni) Mud balls: Mud balls are normally formed near the top of the filter media,\nthough it is not uncommon to have them distributed",
    "ms of\nrapid sand filters are i) Mud balls and ii) Cracking of filters.\ni) Mud balls: Mud balls are normally formed near the top of the filter media,\nthough it is not uncommon to have them distributed throughout the filter.\nThese are formed as a consequence of insufficient washing of sand grains\nresulting in gelatinous film formed during filtration not being separated from\nthe sand grains during washing. They range in size from 25 to 50 mm and\nseriously impair the functioning of the filter. Mud balls are broken and\nremoved using rakes or other suitable instruments. Cleaning of filters with\nwater at high velocity will also help in getting rid of the problem.\nii) Cracking of Filters: Shrinkage of fine material contained in the top layer of\nthe filter may result in the formation of cracks in the filter. Such cracks are\nnormally prominent near wall junctions. The damaged portion of the filter\nmedia has to be replaced to get rid of this problem.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 114\nRate of Filtration: The main advantage of a rapid sand filter is its high rate of\nfiltration, which is about 3000 to 6000 litres per hour per square metre of filter area.\nThe high rate of filtration results in considerable saving of space for the installation of\nfilter.\nEfficiency of Rapid Sand Filters\ni) Bacterial Load: Rapid sand filters are less effective in the removal of\nbacterial load when compared to slow sand filters. They are expected to\nremove between 80 and 90 percent of bacterial load present in water.\nii) Colour:  These filters are highly efficient in removal of colour and the\nintensity of colour can be brought down below 10 on cobalt scale.\niii) Turbidity: Rapid sand filters are capable of removing turbidity to the\nextent of 35 to 40 ppm.

They are found to be less\nefficient when compared to rapid sand filters.\nPressure filters can be cleaned by agitating sand grains using compressed air. The\nvalves for raw water and filtered water are closed and those for wash water and wash\nwater drain are kept open during the process. Frequency of cleaning is more for\npressure filters when compared to rapid sand filters. Automatic pressure filters are\nalso available now in the market in which washing of the filter is done automatically\nat pre-determined intervals of time or loss of head.\nPressure filters are not suitable for public water supply projects, but can be installed\nfor colonies of houses, industrial plants, private estates, swimming pools, railway\nstations etc.\nd) Double Filtration\nDouble filtration, involving filtration of water twice, can be used for better results.\nThis can be achieved either by allowing water to pass through two or more slow or\nrapid sand filters arranged in series, or by passing the water through a raid sand filter\nbefore sending it to a slow sand filter. In practice, the latter alternative is most\ncommonly adopted to increase the filtration rate of an existing slow sand filter. The\nrapid sand filter used in such a way is known as a ‘roughing’ filter. Coarse materials\nare used in the construction of roughing filters, resulting in rates of filtration as high\nas 7000 litre per hour per square metre of filter area. They generally do not\nnecessarily require water pre-treated with coagulant. Double filtration is usually\nadopted at places where there are constraints of land availability for construction of\nslow sand filters.

Installation of roughing filters practically doubles the capacity of\nslow sand filters.\nScreen filters or micro filters, which are readily available in the market, can also be\nused for filtration. Silt and other contaminants present in the roof top rainwater can be\nremoved efficiently using these filters. The size of the filter can be decided based\nupon roof top area and the rainfall amount.\nLocally fabricated filters consisting of buckets or other containers filled with filter\nmedia such as coarse sand, charcoal, coconut fiber, pebbles and gravels may also be\nused to remove the debris and dirt form water that enters the tank in small scale\ndomestic roof top rainwater harvesting systems.

In such cases, it may be\nmore economical to use rainwater to recharge ground water aquifers so that it can be\nextracted at times of need. Long-term rainfall records are necessary to ascertain the\nrainfall pattern.\n7.3.3 Intensity of Rainfall:  The maximum intensity of rainfall in mm/hr for a short\nduration (normally 20 min) will decide the peak flow to be harvested by the roof top\nrainwater harvesting system.

This will have obvious impacts on system specification.\n7.3.7 Number of Users:  This will greatly influence the requirements and design\nspecifications of the rainwater harvesting system.\n7.3.8 Cost: Cost is a major factor in any rainwater-harvesting scheme.\n7.3.9 Alternative Water Sources: Availability of alternative water sources can make\na significant difference to the usage pattern of the water collected using rainwater\nharvesting systems.  If a sustainable and safe ground water source is available within\neconomic distances, a rainwater harvesting system may provide a reliable supply of\nwater for a house/community for the majority of the year. On the other hand, where\nrainwater is to be stored and used only for domestic use, the pattern of use will\ndepend on the quality of water.\n7.3.10 Water management Strategy:  A judicious water management strategy is\nrequired for proper and optimum use of harvested water. In situations where there is\nstrong reliance on stored rainwater, there is need to control or manage the amount of\nwater being used so that it is available for a longer period.\n7.4 Feasibility of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting Systems\n7.4.1 Urban Area\nIn Urban area, water is mainly required for domestic and related uses, and is mostly\ndrawn from surface water bodies, rivers, streams and/or ground water sources.

Important considerations in this regard are described briefly\nin the following sections.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 122\n7.5.1 Existing Water Sources\nExisting water source such as community wells, hand pumps, small water supply\nschemes, ponds and streams shall be studied.  The availability of water, its quality and\naccessibility of these sources during different seasons of the year should be looked\ninto for determining the period for which water may be required from RRHS.\n7.5.2 Roof Catchment\nThe type of roof determines the quality of water that is collected in the storage tank.\nAmong the commonly seen roof types in rural area",
    "for which water may be required from RRHS.\n7.5.2 Roof Catchment\nThe type of roof determines the quality of water that is collected in the storage tank.\nAmong the commonly seen roof types in rural areas, concrete, tiled, asbestos sheet\nand galvanized iron sheet are most suitable as roof catchments. The roof should be\naway from big trees to avoid accumulation of leaf litter and bird droppings. Thatched\nroofs are not suitable as roof catchments because the water collected from these roofs\ngets brownish colour and carries pieces of roof material.\nT h e s l o p e a n d s h a p e of t h e r o o f a r e a l s o i m p o r t a n t i n p l a n n i n g a r o o f t o p r a i n t o p\nrainwater harvesting system.  Water flows with high velocity on steep-sloped roofs,\ncausing overflow or wastage of water form gutters and filter.  Gentle slopes in the\nrange of 10 to 30 degrees are most suitable for smooth flow of water into the storage\ntank.  Roofs having slope more than 30 degrees are to be avoided wherever possible.\nT h e s i ze of r oof i s an oth e r i m p or ta n t f a c tor w h i c h de te r m i n es th e am oun t of w a te r\navailable for storage in the RRHS. Generally, a roof area of 15-20 square meters is\nrequired for collecting sufficient water required for a household.  Roof catchments of\nlesser sizes could become a limiting factor in designing RRHS to the required\ncapacity.\n7.5.3 Rainfall\nRoof top rainwater harvesting systems collect rainwater from the roof catchments\nduring rainy days.  Therefore, the amount and distribution of rainfall are major factors\ninfluencing the dependability of such systems.\nI n I n d i a , a m a j o r p a r t o f t h e r a i n f a l l i s r e c e i v e d d u r i n g m o n s o o n s .

    "ds normally up to September.  The northeast\nmonsoon extends from October to December.  Kerala and north-eastern states benefit\nfrom both the monsoons and hence receive rainfall extending over a period of 7-8\nmonths.  Rest of the country receives rains during southwest monsoon, except Tamil\nNadu, which receives comparatively more rains during northeast monsoon. The\nrainfall is limited to 3-4 month in these regions. The average annual rainfall received\nalso varies across the country, from 200-250 mm in western Rajasthan to >3000 mm\nin Kerala and north-eastern States.\nThe amount and period of rainfall at a given place are important factors that determine\nthe period for which water will be required from RRHS. For example, at places where\nrainfall is received only during southwest monsoon (3-4 months), the period of water\nrequirement form RRHS could be longer than that of places in Kerala and north-\neastern States. Also, in low rainfall areas such as western Rajasthan and northern\nGujarat, roof size could become a limiting factor as households in these areas may\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 123\nrequire water for an extended dry period of 7-8 months.  Here, traditional water\nharvesting systems make use of open lands, adjacent to the house, as catchments areas\nfor domestic water harvesting systems.\n7.5.4 Space\nAmong all the components of roof top rainwater harvesting systems, storage tank is\nthe component occupying most space, and hence the space required for the system\ndepends on the size of the storage tank.  For a typical 10,000 litre tank, the minimum\nspace required is 3.0 x 3.0m.  Therefore, assessment of availability of space adjacent\nto the house shall be done giving due importance to the preferences of the household.\nStorage tanks located near the roof reduce the cost of down pipes.  The site should be\nclean, hygienic and away from cattle sheds to avoid contamination of stored water.\n7.6 Economic Viability\nA ty pi cal",

This\nworks out to Rs.2.34 to Rs.1.49 per litre of water stored. This is quite high when\ncompared to the free water available through government-sponsored schemes, where\ncommunity participation and labour are not required at the construction stage. Hence,\ninvestment to this extent is a costly option and may be unaffordable to many rural\nhouseholds.  The cost of roof top rainwater harvesting systems could be brought down\nto a certain extent by using local materials such as bamboo for gutters, down pipe and\nfi rs t f l ush pi pe.

This would also encourage\nownership and appropriate maintenance of the system at the level of households.\nExtending soft loans repayable in easy instalments would be appropriate for this\npurpose. The existing Government schemes, which finance women self-help groups in\nrural areas such as the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh  and NABARD self-help group\nschemes, could be utilized for extending such loan facilities to the rural households.\n7.7 Social Acceptance\n7.7.1 Acceptance of Roof Water as Drinking Water\nColour, odour and taste are the three important considerations for people in choosing\nsources of drinking water.

In case of water used for cooking, water\nhaving lesser amounts of dissolved salts is preferred, because it consumes less time to\nboil the food grains and vegetables.  As the rainwater contains very little dissolved\nsalts and is almost free from pollutants, it tastes ‘good’ and is suitable for drinking\nand cooking purposes.\nHowev er, i n roof top rai n water h arv es ti n g sy s tem s , water i s col l ected i n th e s torage\ntank during rainy season and is drawn from the system only after other sources like\nponds, wells and hand pumps dry up or become inaccessible to the household.  This\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 124\nmeans that the water collected in RRHS remains stored for a period of 3 to 6 months\nbefore it is actually used. This makes water from RRHS not readily acceptable to\nmany people. Therefore, awareness and education programmes need to be organized\non the potability of water when the system is appropriately maintained. People’s\nperceptions need to be given due importance during such programmes, to enable them\nto develop appropriate understanding of the system.\nDomestic water use varies from place to place depending on the culture and habits of\npeople as well as availability of water.  Water made available at the doorstep is likely\nto increase the water usage.

The motivating\nfactors such as availability of sufficient water, economy and ease in maintenance,\nownership of the system etc., which encourages the people to participate should be\nidentified and proper orientation should be given.\n7.7.3 Traditional Practices of Roof Water Collection\nCollection of roof water on small scale from house roofs to meet the immediate\nhousehold needs is a traditional practice in some parts of India such as north-eastern\nstates, Rajasthan and eastern coastal areas of Tamil Nadu. Small vessels or drums are\nused to collect and store water. Locally available bamboo is split and used as gutters.\nExistence of such practices makes RRHS to meet long-term needs acceptable.\nH o w e v e r , t r a i n i n g a n d t r a n s f e r o f k n o w l e d g e o n s y s t e m a t i c a n d e c o n o m i c a l\nconstruction of these systems is required.\n7.8 Water Quality and Health\nRainwater is often used for drinking and cooking and hence it is vital that the highest\npossible quality standards are maintained. Rainwater, unfortunately, often does not\nmeet the World Health Organization (WHO) water quality guidelines. This does not\nmean that the water is unsafe to drink. It has been found that a favourable user\nperception of rainwater quality (not necessarily perfect water quality) makes an\nenormous difference to the acceptance of RWH as a water supply option. Generally,\nthe chemical quality of rainwater will fall within the WHO guidelines and rarely\npresents problems. There a",

Generally,\nthe chemical quality of rainwater will fall within the WHO guidelines and rarely\npresents problems. There are two main issues when looking at the quality and health\naspects of domestic rainwater harvesting systems.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 125\n7.8.1 Bacteriological Water Quality\nRainwater can become contaminated by faeces entering the tank from the catchment\narea. It is advised that the catchment surface always be kept clean. Rainwater tanks\nshould be designed to protect the water from contamination by leaves, dust, insects,\nvermin and other industrial or agricultural pollutants. Tanks should be located away\nfrom trees, with good-fitting lids and kept in good condition. Incoming water should\nbe filtered or screened, or allowed to settle to take out foreign matter. Water, which is\nrelatively clean, on entry to the tank, will usually improve in quality if allowed to be\ni n s i d e th e ta n k f or s om e ti m e . B a c te ri a en te ri n g th e ta n k wi l l di e of f r a pi dl y i f th e\nwater is relatively clean. Algae will grow inside a tank if sufficient sunlight is\navailable for photosynthesis. Keeping a tank dark and in a shady spot will prevent\nalgae growth and also keep the water cool. As already mentioned, there are a number\nof ways of diverting the dirty ‘first flush’ water away from the storage tank. The area\nsurrounding a RWH structure should be kept in good sanitary condition, fenced off to\nprevent animals fouling the area or children playing around the tank. Any pools of\nwater gathering around the tank should be drained and filled.\n7.8.2 Insect Vectors\nThere is a need to prevent insect vectors from breeding inside the tank.

Mosquito-proof screens should be fitted to all openings.\nSome practitioners recommend the use of 1 to 2 teaspoons of household kerosene in a\ntank of water, which provides a film to prevent mosquitoes settling on the water.\n7.8.3 Water Treatment\nThere are several simple methods of treatment for water to made suitable for drinking\nx Boiling water will kill any harmful bacteria which may be present\nx Adding chlorine in the right quantity (35ml of sodium hypochlorite per 1000\nlitres of water) will disinfect the water\nx Slow sand filtration will remove any harmful organisms.\nx A recently developed technique called SODIS (Solar Disinfections) utilises\nplastic bottles, which are filled with water and placed in the sun for one full\nday. The back of the bottle is painted black.\nThe reasons for variations in chemical constituents and bacteriological properties of\nwater from RRHS could be many, the most important ones of which are listed below:\n Even though the water flows over the house roof for a short distance, it may\nd i s s o l v e s o m e c h e m i c a l s d e p o s i t e d o n t h e r o o f o r t h e r e s i d u e s o f c h e m i c a l\nreactions between the atmospheric gases and the roof material.\n I n g e n e r a l , r a i n w a t e r i s p u r e a n d f r e e f r o m c o n t a m i n a t i o n .

This can be done either by boiling the water in a vessel before consuming\nit or by dissolving bleaching power in required quantity to the water stored in the\ntank.\nFor disinfecting using bleaching powder, the general dosage recommended is 10\nmilligrams of bleaching powder containing 25% of free chlorine per litre of water.\nThis meets the required standard of 2.5 milligrams of chlorine per litre of water.\nAfter adding the bleaching power, the water shall be st",

IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nArtificial recharge structures are constructed mostly with the objective of augmenting\nground water resources and/or to improve its quality. Assessment of impacts of the\nartificial recharge schemes implemented is essential to assess the efficacy of\nstructures constructed for artificial recharge and helps in identification of cost-\neffective recharge mechanisms for optimal recharge into the ground water system. It\nalso helps to make necessary modifications in site selection, design and construction\nof structures in future.\nImpact assessment may require monitoring of the recharge structure, ground water\nregime, changes in pattern of water supply, cropping pattern, crop productivity and/or\nwater quality. In recent years, tracers such as Tritium, Rhodomine B, fluorescent dyes\nand environmental isotopes are also being used for demarcating the area benefited by\nartificial r",

In recent years, tracers such as Tritium, Rhodomine B, fluorescent dyes\nand environmental isotopes are also being used for demarcating the area benefited by\nartificial recharge structures.\nThe methodology of impact assessment is highly site-specific and can vary\nconsiderably depending upon various factors such as hydrogeological set-up and\nground water utilization pattern. General guidelines for impact assessment of artificial\nrecharge structures are discussed briefly in the following sections.\n8.1 Monitoring of Recharge Structures\nSurface structures such as percolation ponds, check dams and cement plugs need to be\nmonitored at regular intervals to assess the actual storage created in the structures,\nperiod of impounding, capacity utilization of the structure, rate of percolation and\ns i l t a t i o n p r o b l e m s i f a n y . Q u a n t i f i c a t i o n o f s t o r a g e i n t h e s t r u c t u r e s m a y r e q u i r e\nsetting up of monitoring devices within the structures. Devices such as gauges for\narea-capacity analysis are commonly used in surface recharge structures. Daily\nmonitoring records are preferred for realistic assessment of storage created by\nmultiple fillings of the structures. Evaporation and seepage losses from the structures\nare also to be accounted properly to evaluate the recharge efficiency of the structures.\nIn case of subsurface structures, the intake water supplied to the structures is\nmeasured by suitable measuring devices. Appropriate measuring devices such as flow\nm e t e r s a n d ‘ V ’ n o t c h e s c a n b e u s e d f o r m e a s u r e m e n t . D a i l y r e c o r d s o f s u c h\nmeasurements help quantify the amount of water utilized for recharge purpose.\n8.2 Water Level Monitoring\nThe objective of water level monitoring is to study the effect of artificial recharge on\nthe natural ground water system.

    "level monitoring is to study the effect of artificial recharge on\nthe natural ground water system. The monitoring system should be designed\njudiciously to monitor impact of individual structures which can further be extended\nto monitor the impact of groups of such structures in the area where artificial recharge\nis being done. Monitoring of water levels during the planning stage of artificial\nrecharge projects helps in assessment of the ground water conditions of the area and\nhelps in identification of the most suitable method for ground water augmentation. A\nproperly designed observation well network is used for understanding the ground\nwater flow pattern and the spatial and temporal changes in water levels/potentiometric\nheads in the area.\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 135\nDuring the planning and feasibility study stage, the observation well network is\ng e n e r al l y of l ow w el l d en s i ty b u t s p r e a d ov e r a l a r g e a r e a wi th th e p ri m a ry ai m of\ndefining the boundaries of the aquifer to be recharged and to know the hydraulic\ncharacteristics of the natural ground water system.  After identification of the feasible\nartificial recharge structures, the observation well network is redefined in a smaller\narea with greater well density.\nFor effective monitoring of the changes in the water levels due to artificial recharge,\nthe network should have observation wells near the center of the recharge facility, at a\nsufficient distance from the recharge facility to observe composite effects and also\nnear the limits of hydrological boundaries. If the aquifer being recharged is overlain\nby confining /semi-confining layers, piezometers should be installed to monitor the\nwater levels of overlying and underlying aquifers separately to study the effects in\nboth the aquifers. In cases where surface water bodies are hydraulically connected\nwith the aquifers being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles",
    "ately to study the effects in\nboth the aquifers. In cases where surface water bodies are hydraulically connected\nwith the aquifers being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles of\nboth surface water and ground water.\nDemarcation of the zone of influence of the artificial recharge structure is one of the\nmain objectives monitoring in the context of artificial recharge projects. The\nfollowing observations are generally associated with the area benefited by an artificial\nrecharge structure:\n1. Well hydrographs in the area benefited will have a flat apex during the\nperiod when there is water in the recharge structure (tank, pit etc.).\n2. Wells located outside the zone of influence normally show an angular apex\nd u ri n g th e p e ri od of r e ch a r g e , w h e r e a s th os e s i tua te d w i th i n th e z on e of\ninfluence have a flatter apex.\n3.

Furthermore, crops with high water\nrequirements are more likely to be grown in the zone of influence.\n5. Well yields in the zone of influence will normally be higher when\ncompared to those outside it.  Wells in benefited zone may have more\nsustainability in lean period than those located outside.\nThe behaviour of water table / piezometric head profile prepared from the data\ncollected from the observation well network over a period of time can clearly\nestablish the efficacy of the artificial recharge scheme. Answers to questions related\nto the extent of the area benefited and the quantification of ground water\naugmentation could also be worked out from such data.

The study of fluctuation over\ntime for both surface and ground water levels in the same area may also indicate\nwhether the ground water augmentation is taking place as envisaged or not. In case\nany deviation is observed, the reasons for the same could be identified and necessary\nremedial measures taken up.\n8.3 Water Quality Monitoring\nA proper evaluation of potential water quality and aquifer quality problems associated\nwith artificial recharge is a key component of a ground water recharge scheme. The\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 136\ndevelopment of reliable pre-, operational and post-operational monitoring programs is\nan integral part of the development of a successful ground water recharge scheme.\nA reliable water quality monitoring system for an artificial recharge scheme will\ninvolve i) Evaluation of existing water quality data, ii) pre-operational monitoring,\niii) operational monitoring and iv) post-operational monitoring.\n8.3.1 Evaluation of Existing Water Quality Data\nThe first step that should be followed in evaluating the potential water quality\nproblems associated with a proposed ground water recharge project is to obtain\ndetailed information on the chemical characteristics of the proposed recharge waters.\nA critical examination of the existing data on the waters that would be recharged to\nthe aquifer should be made to first determine their reliability and representativeness.\nIn case the available data is not consi dered to be reliable, collecti on and analysis of\nsource water samples may be done afresh.\n8.3.2 Pre-operational Monitoring\nThe augmentation of recharge by surface waters and their associated contaminants\ncan greatly increase the potential for ground water quality problems due to the\nincreased hydraulic and contaminant loading. The characterization of ground water\nquality is often not adequately done to properly evaluate potential ground water and\naquifer quality problems associat",
    "increased hydraulic and contaminant loading. The characterization of ground water\nquality is often not adequately done to properly evaluate potential ground water and\naquifer quality problems associated with a ground water recharge project. it is\nimportant to properly assess how the variable parameters in sampling such as bore\nhole volume purged and rate of purging before sampling influences the composition\nof the samples. Chemical parameters of particular importance in reliably assessing\nground water quality samples are the redox conditions within the aquifer and the\npresence of suspended solids in the samples. Because of the chemistry of ferrous and\nferric iron, small changes in the redox (oxidation reduction) characteristics of the\nsample as a result of the introduction of oxygen into the sample during sampling can\ndrastically change the chemical characteristics of the samples. Hence, it is important\nto maintain the oxygen concentrations in a sample collected from an aquifer the same\nas that of the aquifer. Failure to do s o coul d readily change the distributi on between\ndissolved and particulate forms of many trace contaminants of water quality concern.\nThe presence of suspended solids in a water sample from an aquifer is a clear\nindication that the sampling well has been improperly constructed and developed and\n/or the sampling procedure used, especially the purging, has been improperly done.\nAquifers typically do not contain large amounts of suspended material. Aquifer\nsamples that contain suspended material are unreliable to properly characterize\nchemical characteristics of the ground waters within the aquifer at the point and time\nof sampling.\nIt is also important that the sampling program for the ground water is properly\ndeveloped to reflect the site specific hydrogeology of various principal components of\nthe aquifer. Failure to do so could readily lead to erroneous conclusions concerning\nthe chemical characteristics of the aquifer waters and the chemical",
    "hydrogeology of various principal components of\nthe aquifer. Failure to do so could readily lead to erroneous conclusions concerning\nthe chemical characteristics of the aquifer waters and the chemical reactions that can\ntake place within the aquifer upon introduction of recharge waters to it. Depending on\nthe situation, at least one year and often several years of data may be needed to\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 137\nreliably characterize the aquatic system of interest. The best way to determine the\nl e n g t h of ti m e n e c e s s a r y i n p r e - o p e r a t i o n a l m on i t o r i n g a s w e l l a s t h e f r e q u e n c y of\nm o n i t o r i n g a p a r t i c u l a r s y s t e m i s t o e x a m i n e t h e a b i l i t y t o p r e d i c t t h e c h e m i c a l\nc h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f t h e s y s t e m p r i o r t o c o l l e c t i n g t h e n e x t s e t o f s a m p l e s . O n c e i t\nbecomes clear that the characteristics of a particular recharge water source and aquifer\nare predictable with a high degree of certainty based on past monitoring results, it\nshould then be possible to reduce the frequency and duration of pre-operational\nmonitoring. If, however, it is not possible to make these predictions reliably because\nof the high variability in the systems, proceeding with the operation of the proposed\nrecharge project could be met with significant problems in detecting incipient water\nquality problems before they adversely impact large parts of the aquifer.\n8.3.3 Operational Monitoring\nWith the initiation of the recharge activities, a significant increase in the frequency of\nsampling, especially near the point of recharge, should occur. Actually the operational\nsampling program should be initiated several months before actual recharge starts in\norder to evaluate the ability to conduct the monitoring program with the facilities and\npersonnel available. If the pre-operational monitoring program has been passive ,",
    "ore actual recharge starts in\norder to evaluate the ability to conduct the monitoring program with the facilities and\npersonnel available. If the pre-operational monitoring program has been passive , then\ni t shoul d, at the time of ini tiati on of recharge, becom e an active program , where the\ndata is examined in detail as soon as it is available for the purpose of determining its\nreliability and any potential problems that are developing with the recharge project. In\naddition to chemical and microbiological measurements in the recharge waters as well\nas within the aquifer, detailed monitoring of the hydraulic characteristics of the\ninjection / infiltration system should be conducted to determine the changes in the\nhydraulic characteristics of the recharge system and the aquifer in the vicinity of the\nrecharge. In addition to monitoring the chemical contaminants in the recharge waters\na s w el l as a q ui f e r , c on s i d e r a ti on s h oul d b e gi v en t o th e c on ta m i n an t t r a n s f orm a ti on\nproducts that might be formed in the recharge water. An area of particular concern in\nthe recharge waters is whether there is sufficient BOD in these waters to exhaust the\ndissolved oxygen in the aquifer waters for those aquifer systems that are oxic prior to\ninitiation of recharge. Bore hole dissolved oxygen measurements should be made at\nfrequent intervals at various distances from the point of recharge in order to detect\nincipient dissolved oxygen depletion that could lead to its exhaustion from the\nrecharge waters. Since, in general, except for nitrate-related issues, anoxic conditions\nin aquifers tend to lead to poor water quality, care should be taken to prevent the\nrecharge waters from becoming anoxic within the aquifer. Failure to do so could\nreadily result in iron, manganese and hydrogen sulphide problems. If problems of this\ntype start to develop, it may be necessary to add dissolved oxygen either directly or\nthrough the introduction of hydrogen pero",

If problems of this\ntype start to develop, it may be necessary to add dissolved oxygen either directly or\nthrough the introduction of hydrogen peroxide, in the recharge waters in order to\nprevent problems of this type from occurring.\nOnce the operational monitoring program data have become stabilized, i.e. are\npredictable based on past monitoring results, then the frequency of operational and\npost-operational monitoring can be decreased. This will likely take several years of\noperation, however, for fairly constant composition recharge waters and fairly\nhomogeneous aquifer system with respect to its hydrogeologic and chemical\ncharacteristics.\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 138\nThe type of water quality monitoring programme depends on the specific problem\nbeing studied, such as changes in ground water quality, effect of soil salination,\nprevention of any contamination etc.  The samples to be collected will also depend on\nthe purpose and are generally categorized into a) Indicative, b) Basic and c)\nComprehensive.  Indicative samples are collected at 1 to 4 months intervals and are\nused to ascertain the presence of recharged water in the aquifer.  Basic samples are\ntaken at monthly intervals for wells already influenced by recharge to determine the\neffect of recharge on ground water quality and the purification provided by flow\nthrough the soil and aquifer system.  Comprehensive samples are taken at intervals of\n6 months to 1 year for observation wells and production wells to determine water\nquality with respect to specific standards for intended water use.\n8.3.4 Post-operational Monitoring\nWhen groundwater recharge is terminated, it is important that the monitoring of the\naquifer be continued until the waters in the aquifer stabilize in composition.

Rehabilitation was\nnot required as no house or structure was submerged. Around 2.6 ha private\nagricultural land was acquired for the construction work. The construction of tank was\ncompleted in June, 1995 and since then it stored water every year.\n8.4.3 Analysis of Efficiency\nMonitoring of the tank was commenced on 24-6-95 and continued up to 1998. The\ntank balance analysis with regard to the gross storage and percolation fraction etc.\nwere done for the entire period of impounding. The inflow into the tank as observed\nduring various periods was appropriately accounted. Evaporation losses were\ncalculated on daily basis and visible seepage was measured. Thus net percolation\namount contributing to the ground water recharge was calculated as per the procedure\ndiscussed earlier.\nA gauge of 6 metre height was installed and daily monitoring of tank level was done.\nThe contour plan of the tank submergence was prepared, immediately after the\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 140\ncompletion of construction, as shown in Fig. 8.1. The area-capacity curves were then\ndrawn showing the area of submergence in thousand sq m (ThM 2) and storage\ncapacity in thousand cubic metre (TCM) with respect to gauge reading as shown in\nFig. 8.2.\nThe efficiency of the percolation tank in monsoon (June-Oct) and non-monsoon\n(November onwards) of  three  years has been calculated in the range of  95-98% and\n92 -95% respectively. The visible seepage were nil and evaporation losses were\nranging 2 - 5% in monsoon and 5 -8% in non-monsoon. Though the tank has\nmaximum storage capacity of 45 Th M 3  at FSL, due to regular and repetitive filling\noccurring during the monsoon and then its simultaneously  percolation, the structure\ncould store much more quantity of water.

The farmers in the area have switched over to more water\nintensive crops and new dug wells are being constructed which will bring more area\nunder ground water irrigation. The recharge from percolation tank has resulted in the\nsustained yield of ground water during the summer. The rise in pre monsoon water\nlevel up to 2 m was observed during 1996 and up to 6 m in 1997 with respect to 1995.\nThe increase in pumpage hours of dug wells by 2-3 hours per day during Rabi and 1-2\nhours in summer was also observed. It is estimated that an additional recharge of\nabout  150 TCM can bring up to 30 ha of more area under assured irrigation during\nKhariff and Rabi seasons, considering an average crop water requirement of 0.50\nm/year.\n8.4.5 Impact of Recharge on Chemical Quality of Ground Water\nThe impact of ground water recharge on the quality of ground water was also studied.\nThe chemical analysis of percolation tank water and water samples collected from 4\nobservation wells located within the area of tank’s influence were used for the study.\nThe comparison of concentration of various elements present in the percolation tank\nwater, native and augmented ground water  is shown in Table 8.3\nA perusal of Table 8.3 indicates that\n1.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF RECHARGE SCHEMES\nEconomic viability is a critical parameter to be ascertained before taking a decision to\nimplement any artificial recharge scheme. The appraisal of economic viability has to\nbe carried out after taking into account all possible expenses including those for\ninvestigation, source water (conveyance, treatment), construction of recharge\nstructures, operation and maintenance etc. All benefits should be appropriately\naccounted for and assessed in order to decide the acceptability of the scheme as per its\npriority in the overall scheme of development. Economic analysis of artificial\nrecharge projects aims at ascertaining their economic and financial viability.\n9.1 Benefit Cost Analysis\nIt is important to carry out the Benefit Cost Analysis for all major public works before\na decision is taken on the allocation of funds. The Benefit Cost Analysis presents the\nquantifiable efforts, environmental and social aspects of any public projects in money\nterms.\nThe analysis of the financial benefits and costs requires expressing the cash flow\nelements under the non-financial operations in comparable terms. Costs are related to\ninvestments occurring during the lifetime of the project.  However, benefits originate\nf r o m t h e p r o d u c t i v e u s e o f t h e p r o j e c t s .  T h e r e f o r e , b o t h c o s t s a n d b e n e f i t s a r e\nexpressed in quantitative terms and translated into monetary terms by using market\nvalues of the inputs and outputs concerned.

In order to make them comparable, it is customary to express\nboth in terms of their present value by applying the appropriate discounting factors.\nAfter accounting both the costs and benefits against their market values,",
    "m comparable, it is customary to express\nboth in terms of their present value by applying the appropriate discounting factors.\nAfter accounting both the costs and benefits against their market values, appropriate\ncriteria are applied to determine the profitability of the project.\nThe Benefit Cost analysis of the projects is sometimes also called Project Appraisal.\nThis Project Appraisal is done before the decision is taken to invest, whereas\ne v al u a ti on s om e ti m es i s d on e to a n al y z e th e p e rf or m an c e an d ef f ec ts of th e p r oj e c t\nafter it has been executed.\nT h e m os t i m p or ta n t f a c tor s of p r oj e c t a p p r ai s al ar e F i n an ci al , E c on om i c an d S oci al\nBenefit Cost Analysis next to Institutional, Environmental, and Social impact\nassessments.\n9.1.1 Financial Benefit Cost Analysis\nTh e f i nan ci al Ben ef i t Cos t an aly si s vi ews any proj ect f rom th e poi n t of vi ew of th e\nINVESTOR. The analysis would suggest/indicate the investor whether it is\nworthwhile to invest in the project in comparison of other investment opportunities.\nIn practice, the investor may be a private person, a non-government Organization, or a\ngovernment institution.\nIn evaluating the advantages of an investment opportunity, it is essential to give\nproper weightages to two major aspects, i.e., Liquidity Analysis and Profitability\nAnalysis.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 153\nThe liquidity analysis would demonstrate whether, for the entire lifetime of the\nproject, receipts from equity capital and borrowing plus the annual income (Cash\ninflows) will be sufficient to meet the obligations for payments to be made (Cash\noutflows.)\nCash inflows, in this context, comprise the following elements.\ni) Investment funds, which may consist of equity capital or loans,\nii) Loans and credit, during operation, and\niii) Revenues from sales and subsidies.\nOn the other hand, Cash Outflows to be consid",

A number of methods have been developed to measure the\nprof i tabili ty of i nves tm en ts . Th e com m only us ed m eth ods are, i ) Ben efi t Cos t Ra ti o\n(B/C) Ratio), ii) Net Present Value (NPV) and iii) Internal Rate of Return (IRR).\nThese methods are described below in brief.\na) Benefit Cost Ratio: The Benefit Cost (B-C) ratio, also known as ‘Profitability\nIndex’ (PI) or ‘Desirability Factor’ is being widely used in the initial stages of\nproject appraisal.  It is defined as:\nB-C Ratio =       ---------------------------------------\nIf B-C ratio > 1, the project is considered to be attractive and profitable.\nIf B-C ratio <1, the project would not earn the inputs back and are thus not\nrecommended for execution.\nLimitation:\nWithout more information such as net benefits of running costs, cost\nescalation considered for gross benefits etc., the B C ratio is not well defined.\nHence, NPV and IRR should be considered in addition to B C ratio for proper\nevaluation of  projects.\nPresent value of total benefits\nPresent value of total costs\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 154\nb) Net Pr es ent Val ue (NP V) : Th e Net Pres en t Val ue i s uni quely def i ned an d\nwidely used in the selection of ground water development projects and\nartificial recharge project",

It is defined as the difference between the present\nvalue of total benefits and the present value of total costs. In this method, the\ninflows and outflows expected in future are discounted for a change in the\nvalue of money. Accordingly, cash flows expected in future years are\ndiscounted and their values at the beginning of the project are arrived at.\nDiscounting presumes that money, like the other factors of production, has a\ncost. Discounting is done at the interest rate, which is the cost of capital,\nkn own as th e di s coun t ra te. In teres t ra te an d di scoun t ra te are p rac ti cal ly th e\nsame, the only difference being the point of view. Interest assumes looking\nfrom the present to the future, whereas discounting look backwards from the\nfuture to the present.\nThe net present value of investment proposal is computed as\nn\nt\nt = 0\ncft\n( 1 k)\u000e¦\nWhere\ncft = Cash flow occurring at the end of year’t’,\nn = Life of the project and\nk = Cost of capital used as the discount rate.\nIf NPV> 0 (Positive), the project is considered to be profitable and will yield\nmore benefits than the investments.\nThe following example describes the procedure for calculation of NPV.\nAssuming ‘n’ as 5 years, ‘k’ as 10%\nYears           0         1         2           3          4          5\nNet Cash flow      -1000     200     200       250      350      400\n   NPV =\n= 22.1\nHence, the project can be accepted as the NPV is positive.\nc) Internal Rate of Return (IRR):   Though the NPV, which gives the net\npresent value in absolute terms and Benefit Cost ratio, which gives the ratio of\nprofit to cost consider the time value of money, neither of these methods\nindicate the rate of return. The Internal Rate of Return is a measure of the\nreturn on the investment that the project yields.  It is th",

An extended construction period will decrease the present value of costs.\nThe quantitative assessments of benefits in some cases are fairly accurate but are not\nthat easy in most of them. They vary widely depending on the efficiency of the future\noperator or the actual value of the benefits remaining far below the expectations.  As\nan example, some of the irrigation projects or artificial ground water recharge\nschemes in which the peoples’/ farmers participation is not adequate may yield\nbenefits below expectations.

Economic Benefit Cost Analysis\nThe main component of economic benefit cost analysis is to evaluate the resources in\na national context. The analysis views it from the national point of view such that the\nbenefits add to the national economy.\nT h e r e a r e c e r tai n as p e c ts , w h i ch a r e to b e f ul l y u n d e r s to od f or s u ch an al y s e s to b e\ncorrect and realistic. The effects of the projects such as external effects, valuation of\nbenefits and costs, labor wages and perfect completion are to be studied in detail.\nThough these effects constitute a cost or benefit to the society, they are not reflected\nin the project's financial receipts or in expenditures. In addition to this, some aspects\nof e c ol ogi cal d am a g e an d p ol l u ti on of s oi l , w a te r or a i r m ay h av e t o b e ta k en i n to\naccount in the analysis. It follows that the valuation inputs and outputs of the project\ndiffer in financial and economic analysis.  Hence, it is customary to introduce certain\nconversion factors to transform financial prices into economic prices.\n9.1.2.1 Conversion Factors\nThe financial analysis simply uses the market prices of inputs and outputs whereas in\neconomic analysis, the prices that express the real scarcity of the inputs and outputs\nhave to be used. Some conversion factors are required to transform financial prices\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 157\ninto economic prices.

These factors are derived according to the commodity and the\nregion of operation.  In many cases, however, it is neither possible nor practical to use\nspecific standard conversion factors.\n9.1.2.2 Capital and Interest\nT h e v a l u a t i o n o f c a p i t a l i n t e r m s o f t h e r a t e o f i n t e r e s t o r t h e r a t e o f d i s c o u n t\nconstitutes the economist’s interest for evaluating any project proposals.  Sometimes,\nit becomes beyond the limits of the planner to determine the economic rate of interest\n(accounting rate of interest). In fact, a responsible government agency should\ndetermine the rate of interest to be used in the economic analysis in such a way that it\nhelps in adopting a uniform rate for all projects and the results of the analysis\ncomparable.\n9.1.2.3 Economic Appraisal\nThe economical appraisal of any ground water development/recharge project is\ncritical as the benefits are not only indirect but also time-consuming. Certain\nguidelines for economic appraisal are summarized below:\na. The inputs and outputs should be distinguished as ‘tradables’ and ‘non-\ntradables’.\nb. The assumption always is that the project under consideration will not\nchange the price of the output.\nc. Compared to the calculation in financial prices, some adjustments have to\nbe made by applying appropriate conversion factors converting financial\nprices into economic prices.\nd. The economic analysis should not only consider the effects for the\nproducer, but also for the user.\ne. Labor and wages under skilled and unskilled categories have a special\nsignificance in the valuation for economic analysis.  The real contribution\nto the economy probably varies by region, type of labor and season.\nHence, an extensive labor market survey is required for proper analysis.\nf.

Although the computational part of the appraisal is rather straightforward,\nthe essential purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the project has a\npositive effect on the efficient application of national resources.\ng. The outcome of the economic appraisal of a development project is\ndecisive for the acceptance of the project.\nh. If the project is acceptable from the economic point of view but not from\nthe financial, it implies that the project will contribute to an efficient\napplication for national resources with additional requirement of financial\nsupport.\ni.

In such cases, social justice has not\noccurred.  In other words, not only the growth but the distribution of benefits is\nimportant.  This is the essence of Social Benefit Cost analysis.\nThe task becomes easy if the impact of the development project on the distribution of\nwelfare and the proper beneficiaries are identified.

    "lems of ground water management, there are\ncertain common principles, which have to be taken care of for assessment of costs and\nbenefits.\n9.2.1 User Cost\nThe change in storage of ground water at any time is simply the difference between\nthe recharge rate and extraction rate.  It is also to be noted that the effective use of\nground water is attained when the difference between benefits and costs is maximized\nin positive direction over time. In fact, the water pumped in the current period results\nin lowered water table in future periods.  Therefore, the incremental cost of pumping\nf r om th u s l ow e r e d l ev el h as t o b e a c c ou n te d f or , a n d i s c al l ed th e u s e r c os t.

Hence, the change in the user cost\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 159\nover a time is dependent upon the discount rate and the effects of ground water\nstorage on pumping costs.\n9.2.2 Steady State Pumping Condition\nIn certain circumstances, over-exploitation of ground water may be optimal and\ne f f i c i e n t f r om e c o n om i c p oi n t o f v i e w .

    "justified from an economic perspective.  Of course, it is evident that the over draft\nconditions could not be continued indefinitely.\nIn some situations, the ground water level will be lowered until a point is reached at\nwhich the costs of extraction are greater than the benefits generated from various uses\nto which the water has been put.  At this point, it is not economical to abstract ground\nwater at rates greater than the recharge rate. Thus, the relative magnitude of costs of\npumping and benefits ensure that only the annual recharge is being extracted. This\nmeans that the long-term pumping rates should not exceed long term recharge rates\nfor a given aquifer. This ultimate hydrologic condition is referred to as the Steady\nState (i.e., the difference between the recharge rate and the extraction rate equals zero)\n9.2.3 Artificial Recharge Component\nFor obtaining the economics of artificial recharge of ground water, an artificial\nrecharge component is to be included in the analysis.  Additionally, the source water\ncost and the benefits of use must be also be accounted for. It is essential to establish\nwhether supplemental sources of water should be used for ground water recharge or\nf or di rect us e.

However, economic considerations make some particular\nmethods viable in a particular area or for a particular aquifer. Consequently, it is\npossible to estimate upper limits of quantities of recharge through each artificial\nrecharge structure based on studies carried out in different hydrogeological set-ups.\nSome of the typical recharge estimates are given below in general form with field\nexamples from alluvial unconfined/semi confined aquifer systems.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 160\n9.2.4.1 Check Dam & Percolation Tank\ni) Average water spread area         = 'a' Hectares\nii) Seepage Rate                              = 'b' Cu m/sec/million sq m of wetted\n                                                                    perimeter\niii) Inflow and storage period           = 'c' Days\niv) Quantity of induced recharge in MCM\na X 10 X b X 3600 X 24 X c\nAs a case example, assuming the water spread area of each check dam/percolation\ntank as 10 hectares, inflow and storage period of 100 days, monsoon seepage rate as\n2.6 cu m/sec/million sq m of wetted perimeter and considering 4 to 5 floods during\nthe rainy season, surface water recharge of nearly 2.25 MCM through each structure\ncould be considered as realistic.

If possible, financial assistance should be provided to organize\nsmall pilot study projects before undertaking any major projects.\nIt is also necessary to take environmental aspects into consideration and, hence,\nfinancial support should be provided to the afforestation works in the vicinity of the\nproject area.  This attempt will enhance the ground water recharge, reduce soil erosion\nand improve the health of the watershed.\nWatershed management through soil management and water conservation methods\nprovides an enhanced ground water recharge into the flow system.  Therefore, it is\nrecommended that appropriate fund allocation for watershed management should be\nprovided.\nMonitoring of the ground water regime for assessing the sustainability of the project\nobjectives and benefits requires certain committed funds.

As a result, the users have to periodically\nreplace/repair the pumps and in many cases re-drill tube wells. This phenomenon,\nwhich has now become common in many parts of the country results in very high\noperational costs toward ground water development over a period of time.\nAugmentation of ground water resources in such areas will not only help in bringing\nup or in stabilizing of water levels but will also reduce the user's financial\ncommitments toward the replacement of pumps or re-drilling of tube wells.\nSince artificial recharge of ground water is a time-consuming process, the benefits\nwould be felt only over a period of time and will mostly be of indirect nature, as the\nmeasures adopted are mainly oriented towards protecting and improving the natural\nground water environment.\nIt is fair to assume that once the aquifer system is augmented with additional recharge\ncomponent, the institutional finance for ground water development will be available\nto the users. The indirect benefits, which are economical as well as social, could be\nsummarized as below:\na. Control over further depletion of ground water levels, obviating the need\nfor re",

Environmental improvements helping in reduction of pollution hazards.\n9.2.7 Financial Appraisal of the Benefits\nIt is slightly elusive to view the indirect benefits in real financial terms.  In order to\nhave a near-realistic assessment, the financial amounts are shown in general form\nbelow.\ni) Considering 'Z' MCM of additional recharge to ground water which\noth erwi s e goes as s urf ace Run of f , i ts total v al ue ev en at a rate of Rs .\n0.1 per 1 m3 works out to rupees 'R1.'\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 163\nii) The replacement of pumps, say every 5 years for about 100 tube wells\nper year result in saving of Rupees 'R2' per year (Cost of the pump\naround Rs. 7,500).\niii) On an average, 100 tube wells are re-drilled every year.

The annual\nsavings on this account are expected to be nearly Rupees 'R3' (Average\ncost would be around Rs.1,75,000 per well in alluvial area).\niv) Considering the electrical energy saving of 500 KW per tube well per\nyear, the total savings for 'X' number will be of the order of 500 x 'X'\nK W .  Ev en i f v al u e d a t th e r a te of R s . 1 . 0 p e r K W , th e to ta l an n u al\nsaving could be of the order of nearly Rupees 'R4'.\nv) Considering a surplus ground water potential of 'Z1' MCM through the\nabove measures after meeting the existing abstraction, an additional\nirrigation potential of nearly Z1 MCM x h hectare = H hectares (1\nMCM irrigates 100 to 150 hectares under normal cropping pattern) is\ncreated.\nvi) Considering an average return at the rate of 'r' Rupees per hectare\nunder the existing cropping pattern, the additional income from\nagricultural return is likely to be H x r = 'R5' Rupees (one Hectare\nyields an average annual return of Rs. 15,000 under existing cropping\npattern).\nvii) The financial benefits are summarized below for assessing the benefit\ncost ratio of measures for artificial recharge to ground water ( Table\n9.1)\nTable 9.1 Summarized Financial Benefits of Artificial Recharge Schemes\na.

    "ghtly enlarged to suit the ground water\nrecharge projects, which are mainly financed by State or Central Government\nDepartments. In most such projects, the returns to the Government are minimal when\ncompared to investment of capital on other projects.\nTherefore, it is assumed that the annual benefits of 'BR' Rupees will offset the capital\ncost investment of Rupees 'CR' in a tolerable period of say 'Y' years.  Application of\nthis criterion is essential to determine the profitability of the project. For working out\na B/C ratio, it is customary to take the ratio of total benefits to the Annual Cost of\nexpenditure (in Rupees 'AR') for the ground water development projects.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 164\nThis annual cost of expenditure includes i) Interest loss at the market rate of the total\ncost, ii) Maintenance & Repair charges at the feasible percentage rate of the total cost\niii) Depreciation of civil works at the rate permissible, and iv) Some miscellaneous\nexpenditure at a reasonable percentage of the total cost.\nThe above approach is detailed below for the estimation of B/C Ratio (Table 9.2)\nTable 9.2 Computation of Annual Cost of Expenditure\nA.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\nPeriodic maintenance of artificial recharge structures is essential because infiltration\ncapacity reduces rapidly as a result of silting, chemical precipitation and accumulation\nof organic matter.

    ", annual maintenance consists\nof scraping the infiltration surfaces to remove accumulated silt and organic matter. In\nthe case of injection wells, periodic maintenance of the system consists of pumping\nand /or flushing with a mildly acidic solution to remove encrusting chemical\nprecipitates and bacterial growths on the well screens. The intervals between periodic\ncleanings can be extended by converting injection wells into dual purpose wells.\nHowever, in the case of spreading structures constructed with an overflow or outlet\nmechanism, annual desilting is a must. Structural maintenance is normally carried out\neither by government agencies or through initiatives of stakeholders.\nSuccess of artificial recharge schemes and related developmental activities primarily\ndepend on the cooperation of the community and hence, should be managed at the\nlocal level. From a basin management perspective, the division of a basin into many\nm i c r o - c a t c h m e n t s i s , h e n c e , a n e s s e n t i a l r e c o g n i t i o n o f t h e c o m m u n i t y r o l e . T h e\nsuccess of implementation and optimal utilisation of the schemes depend on\nparticipation and active contribution of the public.\nSeveral issues are to be considered in the operation and maintenance of artificial\nrecharge structures. These have been categorised as issues of high concern and\nmoderate concern (ASCE, 2001). Safety, optimisation techniques and programs, value\nof wet-dry cycles, frequency of pond cleaning and condition of filters attached to the\nstructures fall under issues of high concern, whereas security issues and rising ground\nwater levels are among those of moderate concern in this regard.\n10.1 Operational Data Requirements\nRealistic estimates of the quantum of water entering and leaving the recharge\narea/basin/sub-basin are essential for assessing the volume of water that is recharged.\nS t r e am g a u gi n g s ta ti on s i n s tr e am s a r e n ee d e d i f n a tu r al f l ows or a c om b i n a",

In cas e th e en ti re water b ei ng\nrecharged is imported, suitable devices should be used to measure the inflow into the\nstructure. The accounting of a system that has both surface and sub-surface recharge\nstructures should also include devices to measure precipitation and\nevapotranspiration, which should be added to the inflow and outflow respectively.\nInitial measurements should be of sufficient frequency to determine how each of the\nparameters being measured varies with time. Once the variation is determined, a\nschedule that provides accuracy and economy can be set, which should integrate all\nthe data being measured for optimizing data collection costs.\nThe data that should be measured for a recharge system include but are not limited to\nthe following:\n¾ Flow rate, duration and quality of source water.\n¾ Inflow and outflow rates, duration and quality of inflow and outflow into and\nout of each unit of the recharge system.\n¾ Recharge rates versus time for each unit and for the system as a whole.\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 172\n¾ Depth to water and quality of ground water in the area being recharged and\nadjacent areas.\n¾ Power usage by individual units and for the system as a whole.\n¾ Depth to water in the recharge structures versus time ( in case of surface\nstructures)\n¾ Thickness and composition of surface clogging layer when the structure is dry\n(in case of surface structures).\n¾ Pressure versus time ( in case of pressure injection)\n¾ Depth to water in recharge well versus time in case of gravity head recharge\nwells.\n¾ Precipitation and evaporation from surface ponds.\n¾ Temperature of water at inflow and outflow locations.\n¾ Time, rate and volume of p",

Periodic tests of pump efficiency, sampling of\nwater quality and ground water level measurements should also be made and recorded\non a defined schedule.\nMeasurement of any flows that pass downstream of the last recharge structure is\nneeded if the total recharge from the operation is to be assessed. The volume of water\npassing the downstream gauging station, adjusted for precipitation and evaporation\ncan be subtracted from the measured inflow volume to determine the quantum of\nwater recharged.\n10.1.1 Water Level Measurement\nMeasurement of ground water level in the aquifer, also known as ‘static water level’\nor ‘potentiometric head’ is very important in artificial recharge schemes. Water levels\nhave to be measured after a sufficient time has elapsed since stoppage of pumping or\nrecharge to allow the water level to become stabilized and the drawdown/mounding\neffects to be minimized. Measurement  of water levels in wells adjacent to a surface\nor subsurface recharge structure are also important as they help determine the shape\nand rate of growth of the recharge mound.\n10.1.2 Water Quality Measurement\nComplete water quality sampling and testing of a recharge scheme including source\nand aquifer should be done initially to determine the suitability of water for the\nintended use. The testing will provide a basis for the design of any other water quality\ntreatment facilities that may be needed. After implementation of the scheme, periodic\nwater quality assessment should be made.

Proper training should be imparted to the\npersonnel involved to ensure that the samples are not contaminated during collection\nand transportation.\n10.2 Preventive Maintenance\nPreventive maintenance of artificial recharge structures implies a periodic action\ntaken to forestall major repair or replacement of its components. It may be drying up\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 173\nand scarifying of recharge ponds, periodic pumping of recharge wells, or regular\napplication of lubricants / protective substances to the mechanical parts or\nreplacement of minor parts that are subject to deterioration or repeated failure. It also\ninvolves regular observation and recording of the behaviour of both static and\ndynamic components of the system to detect changes in their inherent condition that\nindicates the need for unscheduled maintenance. These include reduction in the\nrecharge rates, temperature of mechanical parts or rate of settlement.\n10.2.1 Maintenance of  Surface Recharge Structures\nArtificial recharge structures such as percolation ponds and check dams are examples\nof ‘wet/dry cycle’ operation (ASTE, 2001) in which the structures get filled up one or\nmore times during monsoon and remain dry during the summer season. These\nstructures can be maintained by removing the silt deposited at the bottom of the\nstructure periodically. The optimal amount of cleaning would remove the\naccumulation of surface material that has reduced the recharge capacity of the\nstructure.\n10.3 Potential Problems\nThe Problems normally encountered in recharge projects are mainly related to the\nsource water available for recharge, which generally require some sort of treatment\nbefore use in recharge installations. They are also related to the changes in the soil\nstructure and the biological phenomena, which take place when infiltration begins, to\nthe changes of land ownership and legal aspe",

They are also related to the changes in the soil\nstructure and the biological phenomena, which take place when infiltration begins, to\nthe changes of land ownership and legal aspects.\n10.3.1 Suspended Material\nA major requirement for waters that are to be used in recharge projects is that they\nshould be silt-free. Silt may be defined as the content of un-dissolved solid matter,\nusually measured in mg/l, which settles in stagnant water having velocities not\nexceeding 0.1 m/hr.  This definition comprises a large variety of materials such as\nclay particles, organic matter and fine particles of calcite. The silt content of river\nwater depends upon the type of soils in the area of run-off, the vegetative cover of this\narea, its topographic slopes, meteorological characteristics prevailing in its catchment\nand intensity of rainfall.\nSuspended matter may clog the soil in two different ways. Near the surface, the\ni n ters ti ces of th e s oi l m ay b e fi ll ed up an d a l ay er of m ud m ay b e deposi ted on th e\nsurface. On the other hand, they may penetrate deeper into the soil and accumulate\nth e r e .

Smaller suspended particles are filtered out in the\nuppermost layer of the soil. The filtration process is governed not only my mechanical\nfactors, but it seems to be strongly influenced by electro-chemical surface forces.\nStill finer particles, especially very fine grains of montmorillonite clay, are carried\nfurther into the soil. Observations in spreading grounds composed of medium-grained\ndune sands, showed that these particles become lodged at depths ranging from 10 to\n20 m b el ow th e s urf ace, an d s om e of th ese parti cl es are carri ed ev en deeper.

Sem i -\npervious layers situated deep below the sand filter out even those particles and\nbecome progressively clogged.\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 174\nMethods to prevent or minimize the clogging effect by suspended matter can be\nclassified into the following broad groups:\n(a) Periodical removing of the mud cake and scraping of the surface layer\n(b) Installation of a filter on the surface, the permeability of which is lower\nthan that of the natural strata (the filter must be removed and replaced\nperiodically)\n(c) Addition of organic matter or chemicals to the uppermost layer\n(d) Cultivation of certain plant-covers, notably certain kinds of grass\nScraping of the surface layer is effective only in coarse-grained soils. In soils\ncomposed mainly of sand, repeated compaction by heavy machinery may easily\nnullify any benefit gained from scraping. Various chemicals and organic matter have\nbeen used to restore infiltration capacities. These include gypsum, various organic\ncom poun ds , cotton -gi n tras h an d al f alf a (grown whil e th e pon d i s s ti ll wet an d th en\nspaded under). The growth of a permanent grass-cover has proved to be an effective\nmethod for maintaining infiltration capacities, but it is difficult to select a grass which\ngrows under a given climatic and soil condition and is able to withstand alternate\nperiods of flooding and drying.\nClogging by biological activity depends upon the mineralogical and organic\ncomposition of the water and basin floor and upon the grain-size and permeability of\nthe soil. The only feasible method of treatment developed so far consists in\nthoroughly drying the ground under the basin.  Experiences seem to indicate that short\nperiods of operation (about one month), followed by drying, are more effective than\nprolonged periods of operation, even if they are followed by a prolonged and most\nthorough period of drying during the hot summ",
    "operation (about one month), followed by drying, are more effective than\nprolonged periods of operation, even if they are followed by a prolonged and most\nthorough period of drying during the hot summer.\nClogging and consequent destruction of bore holes may occur as a result of erosion of\nthe aquifer.  If velocities of flow are too high, fine sand and particles from local clay\nlayers may be dragged outward into the aquifer and clog it or even cause collapse of\nthe well.  The common-sense precautions against these mishaps in semi-consolidated\naquifers are to keep injection rates somewhat below the rate of proved safe continuous\npumping and to avoid frequent sudden changes of the injection rate, which may cause\nvibrations.  Experience has shown that no deterioration of the aquifer occurs if these\nreasonable precautions are taken.\nAir bubbles, which are sucked into the well through the injection pipe, cause violent\nvibrations when they finally escape upwards. The possibility of air seepage must\ntherefore be completely eliminated.  The only certain way to achieve this is to design\nand operate the installation so that positive pressures (exceeding atmospheric\npressure) are maintained everywhere in the injection pipe, even if this entails a\nreduction of injection rates.\nBore holes are much more prone to silting than spreading grounds.  No acceptable\nstandard of turbidity can be given. Clarity of the Water should conform to the\nstandards of good drinking water.  Clogging of the bore hole wall by bacterial growth\nmay occur, even if water of potable standard is injected. Even when chlorination at\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 175\nthe well-head carried out, the wells may still require periodic re-development by\nmechanical means and pumping.\n10.3.2 Environmental Problems\nA number of environmental problems may stem from artificial recharge schemes.\nSuch projects usually have to be carried out in the vicinity of densely populated and\nind",
    "g.\n10.3.2 Environmental Problems\nA number of environmental problems may stem from artificial recharge schemes.\nSuch projects usually have to be carried out in the vicinity of densely populated and\nindustrial areas, where large quantities of water are needed.  The close vicinity of\nspreading-grounds to population centers often creates various kinds of problems.  In\np a r t i c u l a r , i t i s w e l l k n o w n t h a t s t a g n a n t w a t e r s e r v e s a s a b r e e d i n g g r o u n d f o r\nmosquitoes, flies and a variety of other biological nuisances. The best remedy is to\noperate parts of spreading-grounds in sequence, so that water remains in each part for\na shorter period than the larvae stage of the insect's life-cycle.  This remedy may,\nhowever, lead to unrealistically large land requirements.\nOther types of damages can also be generated by such projects.  Artificial recharge is\na procedure designed to raise ground water levels, which, under certain\ncircumstances, can cause substantial damage such as inundation of basement of\nbuildings. Damages may also be claimed if the recharged water is of interior quality\nto that previously enjoyed by nearby well-owners.  Such might be the case where\nsaline water, originating from treated sewerage effluent, is recharged into a freshwater\naquifer.  In such instances, more water is made available, say, for irrigation, but the\npractice may simultaneously create a deterioration of water used for drinking\npurposes.\nThere is no general solution for such problems. Each case has to be studied\nindependently, taking into account the physical, economic, human and legal aspects.\nThere is no doubt, however, that in most cases the overall benefits of such projects in\nwater-short areas largely transcend the drawbacks.\n10.3.3 Water Quality Problems\nVarious chemical processes such as adsorption, ion-exchange, oxidation and\ndissolution are expected to occur during the process of artificial recharge.

    "ty Problems\nVarious chemical processes such as adsorption, ion-exchange, oxidation and\ndissolution are expected to occur during the process of artificial recharge. Adsorption\nprocesses can occur at several levels from precipitated flocs to individual ion\nadsorption. Iron oxyhydroxide and organic flocs are particularly sticky substances and\nusually get adsorbed on aquifer particles and reduce the amount of water that can\nmove through the aquifer. Acidification can be attempted to recover some\npermeability.\nIon-Exchange is significant if the aquifer water is brackish to saline.  The clay\nparticles typically have Sodium in exchange positions and these sodium ions are\nstable in high TDS conditions.  Artificial recharge results in a reduction in TDS due to\ninjection of lower TDS water and this increase reaction between dissolved ions in\nground water. Calcium will replace the sodium in the exchange position, converting\nthe clay to calcium rich clay.  This exchange destabilizes the attached clay particles\nand allows them to move into the pore spaces of the aquifer, causing plugging.\nMost aquifers are under either moderately oxidizing or reducing environments.\nArtificial recharge process with recharge water of more oxidizing nature than the\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 176\nground water will destabilize the equilibrium of native ground water oxidation\nreduction conditions and cause chemical reactions to occur.  Siderite (Iron\nCarbonate), Pyrite and Marcasite are the most susceptible to oxidation by recharge\nwater.  Depending upon how much of these minerals are present in the aquifer, the\nplugging of pores by iron oxyhydroxide flocs takes place.  This plays a major role in\nareas where the pollutants get release and mobilized in an aquifer.\nSolubility is a complex process that can involve several phases.

Carbon-dioxide\nparticipates in macrobiotic reactions and depending on PH, carbonic acid, bicarbonate\nand carbonate form in sequence with increasing pH.  Finally, with sufficiently high\ncalcium and carbonate concentrations, Calcite precipitates.\n10.4  Physical, Biological and Chemical Compatibility of Water\nArtificial recharge through injection wells can be effectively achieved if the recharge\nwater i s ch emi cally an d phy si cally com pati bl e with th e n ati v e groun d water.  If th e\nrecharge water has similar chemical and physical characteristics, it will mix with the\nground water without producing any undesirable effect in the aquifer media.  It is\nimpractical to determine whether the two waters are compatible by using only the few\nknown factors and also it will be difficult to monitor the physicochemical\nenvironment in the aquifer system which is subjected to stress and strain through\nartificial recharge.\n10.4.1 Physical Compatibility\ni) Temperature\nTwo physical properties that relate to the compatibility of the recharge water and\nnative ground water are viscosity and density. Viscosity and density are inversely\nproportional to temperature.  If the injected water is colder than the native ground\nwater, the injected water tends to settle towards the bottom owing to its greater\ndensity and viscosity.  Cold water has greater viscosity and therefore moves through\nthe interstices of an aquifer less freely than warm water. Thus, if the temperature of\nwater in an aquifer is reduced, the effective permeability of the aquifer also gets\nreduced.\nii) Suspended Material\nThe presence of small amounts of suspended material in recharge water will seriously\naffect the performance of an injection well and the aquifer materials adjacent to the\nwell.

The degree of clogging depends not only upon the amount of sediment but also\nupon the composition of the sediment, the size of the particles, the composition of the\naquifer materials and interstitial space in the aquifer.  The effect of clogging in an\ninjection well can be recognized by observing the injection rate and water level in the\ni n j e c t i o n w e l l .

It is necessary to monitor the\nturbidity of recharge water periodically.  During the recharge process, if the records of\nwater level and injection rate indicate clogging, it is necessary to surge (back flush)\nthe injection well with heavy discharge pumps for a short duration.  Surging helps in\nthe removal of silt settled in the well section and in the aquifer zones adjacent to the\nwell.  If the recharge process is continued without surging, the suspended particles\nmay enter into the interior part of the aquifer and it would be difficult to remove the\nparticles settled in the interstices.  It is advisable to do the surging periodically,\nirrespective of any indications of clogging.\niii) Air\nAir introduced into a well during recharge may affect the permeability of the aquifer\nthrough both physical and chemical processes.

    "rge may affect the permeability of the aquifer\nthrough both physical and chemical processes. The air bubbles occupy the space in\nthe interstices, thereby reducing the effective porosity and block the movement of\nwater. The bubbles are normally tightly held on to the aquifer materials by molecular\nattraction and get diffused very slowly.  In fresh water used for injection, the ratio of\ndissolved oxygen, nitrogen and other atmospheric gases is virtually constant at normal\nwater temperature, unless the oxygen content is reduced or increased by biological\nactivity.  Clogging by air bubbles is easily recognized by a sharp increase in injection\nwell water level immediately after recharge operations start. The air clogging is easily\nseen by formation of air foaming when the injection operation is stopped.  Physical\nentrapment of air in the recharge well can be minimized by carrying the injection pipe\nsome distance below the static water level in the well. Surging operations may help in\nremoving some air clogging near the well screen.\n10.4.2 Biological Compatibility\nB i o l o g i c a l s u i t a b i l i t y o f t h e r e c h a r g e w a t e r i s a l s o a n i m p o r t a n t f a c t o r c o n t r o l l i n g\neffective artificial recharge.  Pathogenic bacteria can render a ground water unfit as a\nsource of drinking water. Other harmless bacteria species may lead to coloring of\nground water and cause unpleasant taste and odour. Bacteria in a suspended matter\nmultiply rapidly when their food supply is abundant. When they enter the recharge\nwell along with recharge water and multiply in the well screen openings or in the\ngravel pack, resulting in clogging or reduction in intake rate. In the case of\nbacteriological clogging, the rise in injection head reaches its maximum value after\nsome days only.

Pre-treatment\nthrough slow sand filtration of injected water and chlorination may prevent the growth\nof bacteria in an injection well. Maintaining a residual chlorine level of 1-2 mg/l in\nthe injection well is recommended for minimising the biological clogging.\n10.4.3 Chemical Compatibility\nBore hole injection operations encounter difficulties when the recharge water reacts\nwith the native ground water or with the aquifer material.  The reaction may lead to\nformation of insoluble deposits in the pore spaces, hindering the ground water\nmovement.  Three reaction stages over time and space may be distinguished:\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 178\ni) At the very beginning of the recharge process, the native ground water i s\nd i s p l a c e d b y t h e r e c h a r g e w a t e r .

Formation of mixed zone cannot be prevented,\nbut it is possible to prevent the formation of a mixed zone in the near\nv i ci ni ty of th e w el l b y i nj e c ti n g a n am oun t of n on - r e a c ti v e w a te r , w h i ch\neffects deposition at a distance sufficiently away from the well so that the\nintake capacity of the well is not affected.\nii) With passage of time, all the native ground water in the aquifer is replaced\nby recharge water.

    "PREFACE\nThe dependence on ground water as a reliable source for meeting the requirements for\nirrigation, drinking and industrial uses in India has been rising rapidly during the last few\ndecades. Ground water development has occupied an important place in Indian economy\nbecause of its role in stabilizing agriculture and as a means for drought management. Over the\nyears, particularly since the launching of Five Year Plans, there have been continued efforts in\nIndia for development of ground water resources to meet the increasing demands of water\nsupply for various sectors. In many parts of the country, ground water development has\nalready reached a critical stage, resulting in acute scarcity of the resource. Over- development\nof the ground water resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water\nsupply, intrusion of saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water abstraction structures. These have serious implications on the\nenvironment and the socio-economic conditions of the populace. Worsening ground water\nquality has also adversely affected the availability of fresh ground water in several areas. The\nprevailing scenario of ground water development and management in India calls for urgent\nsteps for augmentation of ground water resources to ensure their long-term sustainability. The\ndiverse nature of the terrain and complexities of hydrogeological settings prevailing in the\ncountry makes this a challenging task.\nCentral Ground Water Board has been in the forefront of activities for augmenting ground\nwater resources through scientifically designed artificial recharge structures for harvesting\nnon-committed surplus runoff which otherwise runs off into sea. A number of pilot schemes\nand demonstrative artificial recharge schemes have been implemented by the Board in\nassociation with various State Government organizations since the 8 th plan period.

    "ificial recharge schemes have been implemented by the Board in\nassociation with various State Government organizations since the 8 th plan period. These are\naimed at popularizing cost-effective ground water augmentation techniques suitable for\nvarious hydrogeological settings, to be replicated by other agencies elsewhere in similar areas.\nBased on the valuable experience gained from such activities, the Board has also brought out\na number of publications on various aspects of artificial recharge. The ‘Manual on Artificial\nRecharge of Ground Water’ is the latest in this series and has updated information on various\naspects of investigation techniques for selection of sites, planning and design of artificial\nrecharge structures, their economic evaluation, monitoring and technical auditing of schemes\nand issues related to operation and maintenance of these structures. Roof top rainwater\nharvesting, suitable especially for urban habitations is also dealt with in detail. This\npublication will be of immense use to all those who are engaged in planning and\nimplementation of ground water augmentation schemes in various parts of the country.\nThe work done by Central Ground Water Board and other Central, State and non-\ngovernmental agencies involved in the water sector have provided the basic inputs necessary\nfor the preparation of this manual. I would like to specially acknowledge the efforts of\nShri.C.S.Ramasesha, Commissioner (GW) and Member (SML) (Retd), Shri.Nandakumaran.P,\nDr.S.K.Jain, Shri.K.R.Sooryanarayana and Shri.Y.B.Kaushik, Senior Hydrogeologists, in\nbringing out this publication.\nI hope this manual will be useful to all agencies engaged in planning and implementation of\nartificial recharge schemes across the country in a scientific manner to ensure optimum\nbenefits.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background\nGround water, which is the source for more than 85 percent of India’s rural domestic\nwater requirements, 50 percent of its urban water requirements and more than 50\npercent of its irrigation requirements is depleting fast in many areas due to its large-\nscale withdrawal for various sectors.  For example, out of a total of 5723 assessment\nunits (Blocks/Mandals/Talukas) in the country, 839 have been categorised as ‘Over-\nexploited’ as assessed on 31 st March 2004, with ground water extraction in excess of\nthe net annual recharge. There are also 226 ‘Critical’ assessment units where the\nground water draft is between 90 and 100 percent of the annual replenishment, apart\nfrom 30 blocks having only saline ground water (CGWB, 2006).\nThere have been continued efforts in India for development of ground water resources\nto meet the increasing demands of water supply, especially in the last few decades.  In\ncertain high demand areas, ground water development has already reached a critical\nstage, resulting in acute scarcity of the resource. Over- development of the ground\nwater resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water supply,\nintrusion of saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water structures. Geogenic contamination of ground water due to\nconcentration of Arsenic, Fluoride and Iron in excess of limits prescribe",
    "and increased pumping lifts necessitating\ndeepening of ground water structures. Geogenic contamination of ground water due to\nconcentration of Arsenic, Fluoride and Iron in excess of limits prescribed for drinking\npurposes (BIS, 2004) have also been observed in many parts of the country. To tackle\nthe twin hazards of de-saturation of aquifer zones and consequent deterioration of\nground water quality, there is an urgent need to augment the ground water resources\nthrough suitable management interventions. Artificial recharge has now been accepted\nworld-wide as a cost-effective method to augment ground water resources in areas\nwhere continued overexploitation without due regard to their recharging options has\nresulted in various undesirable environmental consequences.\nA ‘Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water’, providing detailed guidelines on\ninvestigative techniques for selection of sites, planning and design of artificial\nrecharge structures, monitoring and economic evaluation of artificial recharge\nschemes was brought out by Central Ground Water Board in 1994. It also included\nelaborate case studies and field examples of artificial recharge schemes from different\nparts of the world. The manual has been used extensively for planning and\nimplementation of schemes for augmentation of ground water resources by various\nagencies.\nSubsequent to the publication of the manual, Central Ground Water Board has\nbrought out five publications on the topic in an attempt to disseminate the experiences\ngained during various ground water augmentation projects implemented by the Board\nin the country. They are:\n1) Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water (1994).\n2) National Perspective Plan for Recharge to Ground Water by Utilising Surplus\nMonsoon Runoff  (1996)\n3) Guide on Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (1998)\n4) Guide on Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (2000)\n5) Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water (2002)\nIntroduction\nManual on Artificial Recharge",

Some of the State Departments have also brought out manuals and\nguidelines on artificial recharge to ground water, which dealt with specific areas in\nmost cases.\n1.2 Present Endeavour\nDuring 2004, it was decided to revise and update the existing manual by incorporating\nthe latest advances in the fields of rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge.\nAccordingly, a Committee of the following officers was constituted:\nShri.

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO\n2.1 Global and Indian Water Scenario\nMany of us have an image of the world as a blue planet as 70 percent of the earth’s\nsurface is covered with water.  The reality, however, is that 97 percent of the total\nwater on earth of about 1400 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) is saline and only 3 percent\nis available as fresh water. About 77 percent of this fresh water is locked up in\nglaciers and permanent snow and 11 percent is considered to occur at depths\nexceeding 800 m below the ground, which cann",
    "available as fresh water. About 77 percent of this fresh water is locked up in\nglaciers and permanent snow and 11 percent is considered to occur at depths\nexceeding 800 m below the ground, which cannot be extracted economically with the\ntechnology available today. About 11 percent of the resources are available as\nextractable ground water within 800 m depth and about 1 percent is available as\nsurface water in lakes and rivers. Out of the 113,000 BCM of rain and snow received\non the earth, evaporation losses account for about 72,000 BCM, leaving a balance of\nabout 41,000 BCM, out of which about 9000-14000 BCM is considered utilizable.\nThe annual precipitation including snowfall in India is of the order of 4000 BCM and\nthe natural runoff in the rivers is computed to be about 1869 BCM. The utilizable\nsurface water and replenishable ground water resources are of the order of 690 BCM\nand 433 BCM respectively. Thus, the total water resources available for various uses,\non an annual basis, are of the order of 1123 BCM. Although the per capita availability\nof water in India is about 1869 cubic meters as in 1997 against the benchmark value\nof 1000 Cu m signifying ‘water-starved’ condition ( Fig.2.1), there is wide disparity in\nbasin-wise water availability due to uneven rainfall and varying population density in\nthe country. The availability is as high as 14057 cu m per capita in Brahmaputra/\nBarak Basin and as low as 307 cu m in Sabarmati basin. Many other basins like Mahi,\nTapi, Pennar are already water stressed.\n2.2 Historical Perspective\nIndia is a vast country with very deep historical roots and strong cultural traditions.\nThese are reflected in our social fabric and institutions of community life.  In spite of\nsocial movements of varied nature through the millennia, we have retained the spirit\nand essence of these traditions and have remained attached to our roots.

    "ve retained the spirit\nand essence of these traditions and have remained attached to our roots.  Some of our\ntraditions, evolved and developed by our ancestors thousands of years ago have\nplayed important roles in different spheres of our life. One of the most important\namong these is the tradition of collecting, storing and preserving water for various\nuses.\nThe tradition probably started at the dawn of civilization with small human\nsettlements coming up on the banks of rivers and streams.  When, due to vagaries of\nnature, rivers and streams dried up or the flow in them dwindled, they moved away to\nlook for more reliable sources of water.  In due course of time, large settlements came\nup along the banks of perennial rivers that provided plentiful water. As the population\nincreased, settlements developed into towns and cities and agriculture expanded.\nTechniques were developed to augment water availability by collecting and storing\nrainwater, tapping hill and underground springs and water from snow and glacier melt\netc.  Water came to be regarded as precious and its conservation and preservation was\nsanctified by religion. Various religious, cultural and social rituals prescribed\nWater Resources Development Scenario\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 5\npurification and cleansing with water.

Emperors and kings not only built various water bodies but also\nencouraged the village communities and individuals to build these on their own.\nWide-ranging laws were enacted to regulate their construction and maintenance and\nfor conservation and preservation of water and its proper distribution and use.\nFig. 2.1 Per capita Water availability in India.\nThe Satavahanas (1 st C e",

In the\npeninsular part, where rivers are not perennial and rainfall is scanty, the practice of\ntrapping storm water in large tanks for agricultural and domestic purposes was\npopular. In areas where high ground water table permitted lift irrigation, wells were\ncommon. The Grand Anicut across Cauvery River still remains by far one of the\ngreatest engineering feats of ancient India. The Viranrayana and\nGangaikondacholapuram t a n k s i n T a m i l N a d u a n dAnantaraja Sagara  in Andhra\nPradesh were constructed in the 10 th and 13 th centuries. The Western and Eastern\nYamuna Canals and Hasli Canal in the Ravi were dug in the 16th and 18th centuries.\nUnder the British rule, irrigation development continued with renovation and\ni m p r o v e m e n t o f e x i s t i n g i r r i g a t i o n w o r k s a n d w i t h t h i s e x p e r i e n c e , m o r e n e w\ndiversion works such as Upper Ganga Canal, Upper Bari Doab Canal, Krishna and\nGodavari delta systems were taken up and completed between 1836 and 1866.  By the\nsecond half of the 19 th century, irrigation potential to the tune of about 7.5 million\nhectares (m ha) had been developed.\nBased on recommendations of the First Irrigation Commission, the period during\n1900-1947 saw more irrigation development and the potential created increased to\n2 2 . 5 m h a a t t h e ti m e of i n d e p e n d e n c e .

Construction of large storages like Bhakra, Hirakud,\nNagarjunasagar - called by Pandit Nehru as ‘Temples of Modern India’, were taken\nup and completed. The criteria for economic evaluation of storage projects were\nch an ged f rom th e f i nanci al return eval uati on to a b en efi t- cos t ra ti o ev al uati on . Th e\nreturn to the Government on investment was, thus, no more relevant but benefit to the\nfarmer (at a cost to the Government) became the main evaluation criterion.

The\ncountry achieved self-sufficiency in food grains by producing 200 million tones (MT)\nand import of food grains became a thing of the past.\nThe Second Irrigation Commission, set up in 1969, while not advocating any major\nchange in the policy of irrigation development, cautioned in its report that areas like\nconjunctive use of surface and ground water, command area development, watershed\nd e v el opm en t, i n c r e a s e i n w a te r r a te s t o m e e t O & M c os ts a s w el l a s a p a r t of th e\ninterest on investment also needed attention.\nIn pursuan",

These measures have met with varying\ndegrees of success and have had a bearing on the irrigation development achieved so\nfar and also in shaping the future strategy in this sector.\nGround water development in India is primarily sustained by the farmers themselves\nor by institutional finance.  The public sector outlay is mostly limited to ground water\nsurveys, construction of deep tube wells for community irrigation, services provided\nand grants extended to small and marginal farmers. The flow of institutional finance is\ngenerally about 60 percent of the total outlay for ground water development.\nGround water development has, therefore, occupied an important place in Indian\neconomy because of its role in stabilizing agriculture and as a means for drought\nmanagement.  During periods of droughts, additional dependence is laid on this\nresource since the storage levels in surface reservoirs dwindle and the impact of\nvagaries of weather on ground water is not as pronounced or is delayed.  The stage of\nground water development in the country as estimated in 1991 was about 32 percent.\nBy March 2004, the stage of development has reached approximately 58 percent. This\nis also evident from the growth of ground water abstraction structures from the pre-\nplan period till date.\nThe number of ground water abstraction structures has increased from 5.8 million in\n1982-83 to more than 18.5 million in 2000-2001.

It is not only the main source for water supply in urban areas\nfor domestic uses, but also is the largest and most productive source of irrigation\nwater. The investments in this sector, as part of Minor Irrigation by public and private\nsector, are going on since independence. The Minor Irrigation potential created, which\nwas just 32 percent during the 1 st Plan, increased to 84.4 percent during the 7 th Plan\nperiod (1992-1997).  This is in spite of the fact that investment in Minor Irrigation\nSector had been decreasing in subsequent plans from 56.6 percent (1966-69 Annual\nPlan) to 19.7 percent (1997-2000) of the total plan outlay for irrigation.\nGround water irrigation began to expand rapidly with the large-scale cultivation of\nhigh yielding crop varieties in the second half of the 1960s.

Because\nagriculture and allied activities contribute roughly 30 percent of India’s Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP), with crops accounting for three- fourths of this, the\ncon tri b uti on of groun d wate r (wi th a package of as s oci ate i n puts ) to In di a’s GDP i s\nabout 9 percent. The relation between new technology and ground water development\nhas been two-way. Not only has ground water irrigation helped to spread new\ntechnology, some of the profits earned through new technologies have been ploughed\nback into ground water development, leading to the well- known “tub well explosion”\nin northwest India. This was facilitated by the government’s efforts to promote rural\nelectrification and the banking industry’s institutional credit support, especially after\n1969.\nThe significance of ground water in the economy is due to the fact that agricultural\nyields are generally higher by one – third to half in areas irrigated with ground water\nthan in areas irrigated with water from other sources.  This is primarily due to the fact\nthat ground water offers greater control over the supply of water when compared to\nother sources of irrigation. As a result, ground water irrigation encourages\ncomplementary investments in fertilizers, pesticides, and high-yielding crop varieties,\nleading to higher yields.\nThe strong link between ground water and economic growth has underlain the\ndevelopment strategy of the country. A special agricultural strategy launched for\neastern India (comprising eastern U.P, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, and\neastern Madhya Pradesh) in the mid 1980s, for instance, relied heavily on the\nexploitation of ground water.

    "1980s, for instance, relied heavily on the\nexploitation of ground water.  Since 1987, drilling of free tube wells and subsidies for\npump sets have been provided throughout the region. This approach appears to have\npaid rich dividends. Rice production, the main food crop of this region, increased\nrapidly and reasonable progress was made on poverty reduction.\nDevelopment of ground water has led to increased “drought proofing” of India’s\nagricultural economy. In the 1960s, ground water was a relatively insignificant source\nof irrigation, particularly in eastern India. In 1965-66, monsoon rainfall (June to\nSeptember) was 20 percent below normal, leading to drought conditions, which\nresulted in the decline of food production by 19 percent at the national level. In\ncontrast, in 1987-88, rainfall was almost 18 percent below normal, but food grain\nproduction declined only by 2 percent over the previous year’s level. Much of this\nimprovement can be attributed to the spread of irrigation in general and of ground\nwater irrigation in particular.\nThe impact of Ground water development has extended beyond the owners of wells.\nStudies have indicated that farmers who own wells achieve the highest yields, while\nfarmers who purchase water achieve higher yields than farmers who depend on canal\nirri gati on al one, but not as hi gh as the yields achieved by the owners of wells. They\nalso consume more fertilizer, labour, and other inputs. Thus, the expansion of ground\nwater irrigation is a major catalyst for rural development.\nGround water plays a key contributory role to agricultural GDP and drought\nmitigation. The spread of ground water irrigation supports employment generation\nand thus rural development and poverty alleviation.

As productivity is higher in irrigated land, better access to irrigation reduces\npoverty in rural areas.\n2.4 Emerging Challenges\nGround water management is the foremost challenge being faced today by the\norganizations dealing with ground water in India.  The activities and policies affecting\nground water need to reflect the priority issues with the overall objective of providing\nwater security through ground water management in a major part of the country.\nCentral Ground Water Board, being the apex organization at the central level with\nvast experience in the ground water sector, has taken a proactive role in identifying\nvarious key issues, which need immediate attention.  These issues are discussed below\nin brief\n2.4.1 Ground Water Depletion\nIndiscriminate ground water development has led to substantial ground water level\ndeclines both in hard rocks and alluvial areas threatening sustainability of this\nresource.    Long-term decline of ground water levels is being observed in many areas,\nm os tl y i n th e s tates of Raj as th an , Guj arat, Tam il Nadu, Punj ab , Del hi an d Hary an a.\nApart form this, in most of the cities depending on ground water for drinking water\nsupplies, water level declines up to 30 m and more have been observed. Traditional\nwater harvesting methods, which were in vogue in arid and semi-arid areas of the\ncountry have either been abandoned or have become defunct in most cases. There is\nan urgent need to revive these methods.\nIn some parts of the country like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi, the in-\nstorage or static ground water resources are also limited and depletion in ground water\nlevel is resulting in ground water drought scenario.  In such areas, it may become very\ndi f f i c ul t f or th e S ta te t o p r ov i de w a te r s e c u ri ty f or v a r i ou s u s e r s . E x c e s s i v e g",

E x c e s s i v e g r ou n d\nwater development has resulted in deterioration of ground water quality in coastal\nareas due to saline water ingress.  Ground water development, therefore, needs to be\nregulated and augmented through suitable measures to provide sustainability and\nprotection.  Dependence on use of ground water for agriculture due to monsoon\nfailures is accelerating ground water depletion. Excessive withdrawal of ground water\nis further compounding the stress on ground water system due to free/subsidized\npower in some States. In order to tackle the burgeoning problem of water level\ndecline, it is necessary to take up schemes for water conservation and artificial\nrecharge to ground water on priority.\n2.4.2 Ground Water Pollution\nGround water resources in several areas of the country are getting polluted due to over\napplication of fertilizers and pesticides, indiscriminate disposal of effluents from\nindustries and urban sewerage. Surveillance studies to determine the type and\nmigration of pollution and measures for its control have become an absolute necessity\nfrom the point of view of long-term sustainability of ground water resources. Purpose-\ndriven studies need to be undertaken to find suitable mitigation measures to combat\nthis problem.\nWater Resources Development Scenario\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 11\nPresence of naturally occurring Arsenic, Fluoride and Iron in ground water in excess\nof permissible limits recommended for human consumption prohibits its use for\ndrinking purposes in several states of India.

Dilution of\npollutant concentration through ground water recharge can be one of the effective\nways to mitigate the hazards of high concentration of these constituents. It is also\ndesirable that rural water supply schemes be formulated and arrangements made to\nutilize fluoride / arsenic rich water for purposes other than drinking.\n2.4.3 Drinking Water Shortage in Urban Areas\nThere are several urban areas in the country where water supply systems are based\nmainly on ground water resource.  Sustainability of urban water supply is one of the\ncore issues the planners across the country are facing at present. The problem may get\naggravated in near future with the rapid pace of urbanization being witnessed in India.\nPotable drinking water is an important input for providing municipal supply to the\nu r b a n c o m p l e x e s .

These problems could be solved to some extent by\ni) Shifting of ground water pumpage from the center of the cities to flood\nplain areas having proven capabilities of sustaining high yielding tube wells\nwherever possible,\nii) Recycling and reuse of water,\niii) Dual water supply systems for drinking and other domestic uses,\niv) Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting and\nv) Regulatory measures through proper pricing and metering of water\nsupplied.\n2.4.4 Seawater Ingress in Coastal Aquifers\nThe unconsolidated deltaic and coastal sediments form thick and regionally extensive\naquifers having prolific yield potential that can sustain deep, moderate to high\ncapacity tube wells.

    "water resources have been\nidentified in regionally extensive deltaic and coastal tracts, particularly along the east\ncoast, inherent quality problems restrict their development. The ground water in these\naquifers exists in a fragile dynamic equilibrium with seawater. Indiscriminate\nexploitation of ground water from such aquifers can disturb this equilibrium and result\nin the development of landward hydraulic gradient, ultimately leading to seawater\nintrusion into the fresh water aquifers. Coastal aquifers in parts of Gujarat, Tamil\nNadu and Andhra Pradesh are already suffering from the problem of salinity ingress.\nMeasures to prevent/control saline water intrusion into coastal aquifers include\ni) Regulation of ground water development in coastal areas.\nii) Formation of a freshwater ridge parallel to the coast through artificial\nrecharge.\niii) Formation of a pumping trough through a series of pumping wells\naligned parallel to the coast\nArtificial Recharge of Ground Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 12\n3. ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE OF GROUND WATER\nThe term artificial recharge has different connotations for various practitioners.\nA r ti f i ci al r ech a r g e to g r ou n d w a te r i s d ef i n e d as th e r e ch a r g e th a t oc c u r s w h en th e\nnatural pattern of recharge is deliberately modified to increase recharge (ASCE\n2001).

What is artificial is\nth e av ail abili ty of water s upply at a parti cul ar l ocati on an d a parti cul ar ti m e. In th e\nbroadest sense one can define artificial recharge as “any procedure, which introduces\nwater in a pervious stratum”.\nThe term artificial recharge refers to transfer of surface water to the aquifer by human\ninterference. The natural process of recharging the aquifers is accelerated through\np e r c o l a ti o n of s t o r e d o r f l o w i n g s u r f a c e w",

Artificial recharge is also defined as the process by which ground\nwater is augmented at a rate exceeding that under natural condition of replenishment.\nTherefore, any man-made facility that adds water to an aquifer may be considered as\nartificial recharge (CGWB, 1994)\nArtificial recharge aims at augmenting the natural replenishment of ground water\nstorage by some method of construction, spreading of water, or by artificially\nchanging natural conditions. It is useful for reducing overdraft, conserving surface\nrun-off, and increasing available ground water supplies. Recharge may be incidental\nor deliberate, depending on whether or not it is a by-product of normal water\nutilization.\nA rti f i ci al rech arge can al s o b e def i ned as a proce s s of i nduced repl eni shm en t of th e\nground water reservoir by human activities.

Concept of Recharge\nFlow below the land surface takes place due to the process of infiltration. The soil will\nnot get completely saturated with water unless water supply is maintained for\nprolonged periods. If water is applied only intermittently, there may be no recharge\nduring the first infiltration or even between two subsequent infiltrations. The\nevolution of water in the soil during the period between two instances of infiltration is\nreferred to as redistribution. Recharge may take place even when no hydraulic\nconnection is established between the ground surface and the underlying aquife",
    "od between two instances of infiltration is\nreferred to as redistribution. Recharge may take place even when no hydraulic\nconnection is established between the ground surface and the underlying aquifer.\nThe hydraulic effects generated by artificial recharge are basically of two types, viz.\npiezometric effect and volumetric effect. The piezometric effect results in a rise of the\npiezometric surface, the magnitude of which depends on the geologic and hydraulic\nboundaries of the aquifer being recharged and the type, location, yield and duration of\nt h e r e c h a r g e m e c h a n i s m .

Other factors such as capillary forces, water temperature and presence of\nair bubbles in the aquifer also have an impact on the piezometric effect.\nThe volumetric effect is related to the specific yield, replenishment coefficient,\ntransmissivity and the geologic and hydraulic boundaries of the aquifer. Model studies\nthat were checked through field experiments have demonstrated that the bulk of the\nArtificial Recharge of Ground Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 13\nrecharge water moves according to two systems of flow, one resulting in a spreading-\nout effect with a speed related to the recharge flow and the other in a sliding effect,\nwith a speed related to ground water flow.\n3.2 Need for Artificial Recharge\nNatural replenishment of ground water reservoir is a slow process and is often unable\nto keep pace with the excessive and continued exploitation of ground water resources\nin various parts of the country. This has resulted in declining ground water levels and\ndepletion of ground water resources in such areas. Artificial recharge efforts are\nbasically aimed at augmentation of the natural movement of surface water into ground\nwater reservoir through suitable civil construction techn",
    "resources in such areas. Artificial recharge efforts are\nbasically aimed at augmentation of the natural movement of surface water into ground\nwater reservoir through suitable civil construction techniques. Such techniques inter-\nrelate and integrate the source water to ground water reservoir and are dependent on\nthe hydrogeological situation of the area concerned.\nOccurrence of rainfall in India is mostly limited to about three months in a year. The\nnatural recharge to ground water reservoir is restricted to this period only in a major\npart of the country. Artificial recharge techniques aim at extending the recharge\nperiod in the post-monsoon season for about three or more months, resulting in\nenhanced sustainability of ground water sources during the lean season.\nIn arid regions of the country, rainfall varies between 150 and 600 mm/ year with less\nthan 10 rainy days. A major part of the precipitation is received in 3 to 5 major storms\nlasting only a few hours. The rates of potential evapotranspiration (PET) are\nexceptionally high in these areas, often ranging from 300 to 1300 mm. In such cases,\nthe average annual PET is much higher than the rainfall and the annual water resource\nplanning has to be done by conserving the rainfall, by storing the available water\neither in surface or in sub-surface reservoirs. In areas where climatic conditions are\nnot favourable for creating surface storage, artificial recharge techniques have to be\nadopted for diverting most of the surface storage to the ground water reservoirs within\nthe shortest possible time.\nIn hilly areas, even though the rainfall is comparatively high, scarcity of water is often\nfelt in the post-monsoon season, as most of the water available is lost as surface run-\noff.  Springs, the major source of water in such terrains, are also depleted during the\npost monsoon period.

In such areas, rainwater harnessing and small surface storages\nat strategic locations in the recharge areas of the springs can provide sustainable\nyields to the springs as well as enhance the recharge during and after rainy season.\n3.3 Purposes and Principles of Artificial Recharge\nThere are many reasons why water is deliberately placed into storage in ground water\nreservoirs. A large percentage of artificial recharge projects are designed to replenish\nground water resources in depleted aquifers and to conserve water for future use.\nOther such projects recharge water for various objectives such as control of salt-water\nencroachment, filtration of water, control of land subsidence, disposal of wastes and\nrecovery of oil from partially depleted oil fields.\nIn certain coastal areas of the world, artificial recharge systems for blocking inland\ne n c r o a c h m e n t o f s e a w a t e r a r e i n o p e r a t i o n .

The benefits of artificial\nrecharge can be both tangible and intangible. The important advantages of artificial\nrecharge are\nx Subsurface storage space is available free of cost and inundation is avoided\nx Evaporation losses are negligible\nx Quality improvement by infiltration through the permeable media\nx Biological purity is very high\nx It has no adverse social impacts such as displacement of population, loss of scarce\nagricultural land etc\nx Temperature variations are minimum\nx It is environment friendly, controls soil erosion and flood and provides sufficient\nsoil moisture even during summer months\nx Water stored underground is relatively immune to natural and man-made\ncatastrophes\nx It provides a natural distribution system between recharge and discharge points\nx Results in energy saving due to reduction in suction and delivery head as a result\nof rise in water levels\n3.5 Implementation of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nSuccessful implementation of artificial recharge schemes will essentially involve the\nfollowing major components\n¾ Assessment of source water\n¾ Planning o",

SOURCE WATER\nAvailability of source water is one of the basic prerequisites for taking up any\nartificial recharge scheme. The source water available for artificial recharge could be\nof the following types:\ni) Insitu precipitation in the watershed / area\nii) Nearby stream/ spring / aquifer system\niii) Surface water (canal) supplies from large reservoirs located within the\nwatershed/basin\niv) Surface water supplies through trans-basin water transfer\nv) Treated Municipal/industrial wastewaters\nvi) Any other specific source(s)\nThe availability of water for artificial recharge from all these sources may vary\nconsiderably from place to place. In any given situation, the following information\nmay be required for a realistic assessment of the source water available for recharge.\ni) The quantum of non-committed water available for recharge\nii) Time for which the source water will be available.\niii) Quality of source water and the pre-treatment required.\niv) Conveyance system required to bring the water to the proposed recharge\nsite.\nRainfall and runoff available constitute the major sources of water for artificial\nrecharge of ground water. Rainfall is the primary source of recharge into the ground\nwater reservoir. Other important sources of recharge include seepage from tanks,\ncanals and streams and the return flow from applied irrigation.

    "evaluation\nof source water availability, a thorough understanding of rainfall and runoff is\nessential. Collection and analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological data have\nan important role to play in the assessment of source water availability for planning\nand design of artificial recharge schemes. These are elaborated in the following\nsections.\n4.1 Rainfall\nRainfall in the country is typically monsoonal in nature. ‘Monsoon’ literally means\nseasonal wind. It is basically a part of the trade wind system. The southeast trade\nwinds and northeast trade winds converge at the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone\n(ITCZ). Due to uneven distribution of land and water masses, it is crooked in shape\nand keeps shifting seasonally. During its northwards movement, it draws the southeast\nt r a d e s a l o n g w i th i t .  A f t e r c r o s s i n g t h e e q u a t o r , t h e w i n d s c h a n g e d i r e c ti o n b y 9 0\ndegrees (due to Coriolis force), taking a southwesterly direction. Hence, these\nseasonal winds are named Southwest monsoon. It lasts for four months, from June to\nSeptember. While traversing the vast stretches of water, (Bay of Bengal and Arabian\nSea), these winds pick up lot of moisture. On an average, annually, about 1120 mm of\nrainfall is received in the country. Bulk of this rainfall occurs during Southwest\nmonsoon.\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 16\nThese moisture-laden winds normally hits the Kerala coast around May end. As it\nadvances over the peninsula, copious amounts of rainfall occur all along the west\ncoast and the adjoining mountains.  After crossing the mountains, the current\nweakens. At the same time, the Bay of Bengal branch of the monsoon gives rise to\nheavy rainfall in the Bay islands during the month of May. This branch encounters the\nhill ran ges of Nor th eas t an d th en takes a wes terl y cours e. A s a con sequen ce, h eavy\nrains occur in the northeast as also along the foothills of Himalayas.

T h u s , t h e en ti r e c ou n tr y i s c ov e r e d b y th e\nsummer monsoon for two months, July and August, making them the wettest months.\nThe monsoon starts withdrawing gradually by early September and leaves the country\nb y m i d d l e o f O c t o b e r .

This\nmonsoon lasts for nearly three months, from October to December. It is a relatively\ndry season as compared to its summer cousin. It is largely confined to the southeast\nand interior southern parts of the country. Rainfall is confined mainly to the month of\nOctober and to a lesser extent up to the middle of November.\n4.1.1 Measurement of Rainfall\nRainfall is measured by a rain gauge, either manual or automatic. It is installed in an\nopen area on a concrete foundation. The distance of the rain gauge from the nearest\nobject should be at least twice the height of the object.  It should never be on a terrace\nor under a tree.  The gauge as also other instruments may be fenced with a gate to\nprevent animals and unauthorized persons from entering the premises. Measurements\nare to be made at a fixed time, normally at 0830 hrs. In case of heavy rainfall areas,\nmeasurements are made as often as possible.\nFig. 4.1 Non-recording Rain Gauge\n\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 17\nA manual gauge is basically a collector (funnel) and a bottle ( Fig 4.1).

    "Source Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 17\nA manual gauge is basically a collector (funnel) and a bottle ( Fig 4.1).  It is made of\nFibreglass-reinforced Plastic. The stem of the collector or receiver is led into a bottle\nkept in the base unit.\nRainwater collected in the bottle is measured by a calibrated jar or cylinder. The\ngauges are designed on the basis of cross sectional area of the collector or funnel,\neither 200 sq cm or 100 sq cm. The former is recommended for use where rainfall in\n24 expected to be more than 200 mm. The latter is used where rainfall in a day does\nnot exceed 200 mm. Thus, one cm rain gives 100 cc of water in the bottle in the case\nof 100 sq cm collector or 200 cc in the case 200 sq cm collector.\nAn automatic rain gauge gives a continuous record of rainfall. In addition to recording\ndirectly a) the total amount of rainfall that has fallen since the record was started, b)\nth e ti m e s of on s e t a n d c es s a ti on of r ai n an d th e ref or e , c ) th e d u r a ti on of r ai n f al l . I t\nalso gives d) the rate of rainfall.  Installation procedure is the same as that for manual\ngauge.  Normally, automatic gauges are installed alongside manual gauges for use as\na s t a n d a r d , b y m e a n s o f w h i c h t h e r e a d i n g s o f t h e r e c o r d i n g r a i n g a u g e c a n b e\nchecked, and if necessary, adjusted.\nRainwater entering the gauge at the top of the cover is led via the funnel to the\nreceiver. The receiver consists of a float chamber and a siphon chamber. A pen is\nmounted on the stem of the float and as the water level rises in the receiver, the float\nri s es an d th e p en r e c or d s on a ch a r t m ou n te d on a cl oc k d r um .

If there is no rain, the pen traces a horizontal line from where it leaves off\nrising. The diameter of the funnel is 203 mm and height of the gauge is 600 mm.\nThere are other types of recording rain gauges such as tipping bucket, digital rain\ngauge etc, which facilitate telemetry of data.\n4.1.2 Rain Gauge Network\nF or pr ope r as s es sm en t of water res ou rces , a g ood n etwork of rai n gauges i s a m us t.\nThe planning of such a network primarily depends on physical factors which affect\nh y d r ol ogy s u ch a s t op og r a p h y , m or ph ol ogy , l an d u s e an d s oi l ty p es . I n h i l l y a r ea s ,\nwhere heavy rainfall characterized by extreme variability is experienced, the network\nshould be carefully planned. More the variability of rainfall, denser should be the rain\ngauge network. As per the IS: 4987-1968, the recommended rain gauge network\ndensity in plains is one rain gauge for every 520 sq km, whereas in moderately elevated\nareas (average elevation up to 1000 m), it is one in 260 to 390 sq km. Hilly areas, where\nv e r y h e a v y r a i n f a l l i s e x p e c t e d , a r e a l s o a r e a s o f e x t r e m e r a i n f a l l v a r i a b i l i t y . T h e\nnetwork density in such areas, if economically feasible, should be one rain gauge for\nevery 130 sq km. As far as possible, 10 percent of the rain gauge stations should be\nequipped with automatic (self recording) rain gauges.\nA n i m p o r ta n t f a c t o r i n th e d e s i g n of th e n e tw o r k i s th e a c c u r a c y w i th w h i c h r a i n f al l\nover the catchment is to be assessed. A relation involving optimum number of rain\ngauges required and variability of rainfall among the existing rain gauges is expressed\nas\nN = (Cv/P)2   or   P = (Cv)/(N1/2)\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 18\nwhere N is the opt",
    "required and variability of rainfall among the existing rain gauges is expressed\nas\nN = (Cv/P)2   or   P = (Cv)/(N1/2)\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 18\nwhere N is the optimum number of rain gauges, Cv is coefficient of variability of the\nrainfall values of the existing rain gauge stations and P, the permissible percentage error\nin the estimate of basin mean rainfall.\nNormally, the mean rainfall is estimated up to an error (P) not exceeding 10 percent.\nIf ‘N’ increases, the error would decrease. Thus, depending on the desired accuracy of\nthe estimate, the number of rain gauges should be planned. For micro level studies of\nsmall watersheds, the error may not exceed 5 percent. In case of routine hydrological\ninvestigations, error of estimate may not exceed 10 percent. Relative distances\nbetween the gauges, accessibility, operating costs and availability of trained observers\nare to be taken into account while setting up new gauges.\nThe allocation of additional gauges depends on the spatial distribution of existing rain\ngauging stations and the variability of rainfall over the basin. For this purpose,\nisohyets of equal intervals are drawn, based on the existing gauges. Areas between\ntwo successive isohyets and their proportion with respect to total area are computed.\nThe optimum number (i.e., existing plus additional) should be distributed to the\ndifferent isohyetal zones in proportion of their areas.\nExample: A catchment has 4 rain gauges recording an annual rainfall of 800, 540, 445\nand 410 mm.  Optimum number of rain gauges (N) required for estimating the average\ndepth of rainfall  is computed in the following manner.\nMean rainfall   =  548.75      Standard Deviation  =  176.26\nCoefficient of variation (Cv)     =   32.12\b    N=  (Cv / P)2 =   10.32  i.e. 10\n It can be seen that the existing network of 4 rain gauges is inadequate and 6 new\ngauges are to be installed for a realistic estimate of average depth of rainfall.\n4.1.3 Normals of Ra",

If th e f r e q u e n c y di s t r i b u ti on of m e an a n n u a l r ai n f al l b e c om e s s ta b l e af te r a\ncertain period, the addition of further years of observations does not add significantly to\nthe accuracy.  The length or period of record needed to achieve stability varies between\nseasons and regions.  From experience it is observed that rainfall data of 30 years is\nadequate under Indian conditions. This period encompasses dry as well as wet cycles\nand is called the normal period. Averages of normal periods are termed normals. These\nnormals need updating to account for changes in environment and land use. The current\nnormal period is 1971-2000. Normals or averages, based on data for that period are\nused for making comparisons with data of the following decade.\n4.1.4 Double Mass Curve\nConsistent rainfall data is essential for resources evaluation. Due to change of location\nof a rain gauge or its exposure conditions, the data becomes inconsistent.  This can be\nrectified by plotting cumulative rainfall of the gauge in question against average\ncumulative rainfall of a number of surrounding gauges.  Such a plot is known as a\nDouble Mass Curve (Fig. 4.2).\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 19\nFig. 4.2 Double Mass Curve\nIn case of inconsistency, there will be a change in slope of the straight plot. It is\nassumed that the average of group of stations used as basis of comparison does not have\nany inconsistency in itself. Only significant changes in slope are considered. Usually,\nvalues of previous period i.e., before change in slope are adjusted to the current period\ni.e., after change of slope. The adjustment factor is",

The apparent change can be verified, and if\nnecessary, rectified by means of double mass curves as described above. Evidence of\nreal trends may be ascertained from the study of progressive long-term averages using\n3 year or 5 year moving averages ( Fig.4.3). For three year moving average, the\nrainfall is averaged over successive three-year periods. The first average is obtained\nfor years one, two and three, the second average for years two, three and four and so\non. The first average is plotted against year two, the second one against three and so\non.  In the case of 5 year moving average, years one, two, three, four and five are\na v e r a g e d a n d p l o t t e d a g a i n s t y e a r t h r e e a n d s o o n .

The period can be changed to 7 years or even 9 years.\n\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 20\nFig. 4.3  Moving average\n4.1.6 Supplementing Data\nIt is often necessary to supplement incomplete rainfall records by estimating values that\nare missing at one or more stations. Short period missing data of say, a single storm can\nbe interpolated from an isohyetal map drawn with available data. For longer periods,\nsay a month or an year, normal rainfalls are considered for interpolation.

    "eriods,\nsay a month or an year, normal rainfalls are considered for interpolation. In one\napproach, it is assumed that the ratio of monthly or annual rainfall of two adjacent\ngauges is equal to the ratio of the normal rainfalls for the same period of the two\ngauges. It is expressed as:\nRx = Ry (Nx / Ny)\nwhere ‘x’ is the rain gauge whose records are to be interpolated  and ‘y’, the nearest rain\ngauge station. Rx is the rainfall at gauge ‘x’ and Ry, the rainfall at gauge ‘y’. Nx and\nNy are normal rainfall at ‘x’ and ‘y’ respectively.\nExample:    Rain gauge      Normal     Actual\n                        X               1125              ?\n                        Y                910             865\n      Actual Rainfall at X = 865(1125/910) = 1069\nIn another approach, at least three rain gauges with continuous records, as close to and\nas evenly spread around the gauge with missing records as possible, are chosen. If the\nnormal rainfall at each of the gauge is within 10 percent of that for the gauge with\nmissing records, then the arithmetic mean of the rainfall of the three surrounding gauges\n              Year\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 21\nis used as that of the gauge in question.

The average is usually obtained by any of the three methods; Arith-\nmetic mean, Theissen polygon and isohyetal.  The first one is a simple average whereas\nthe other two give weighted averages.\n4.1.7.1 Arithmetic Mean Method\nIn this method, the average depth of rainfall is computed as\nP = (P1 + P2 + P3 + ………………+ P n )/ n\nwhere, P is the average rainfall, n, the number of years of data and P1, P2, P3 ……… P n ,\nprecipitations measured at stations 1, 2,3 ……… n.\n4.1.7.2 Theissen Polygon Method\nIn this method, weights are assigned to each rain gauge depending on its relative\nlocation.  This method involves constructing polygons around each gauge, which are a\nresult of perpendicular bisectors of lines joining two adjacent rain gauges.  The polygon\nth us f orm ed f orm th e b oun da ry of th e ef f ecti v e area as s um ed to b e c on tr ol l ed by th e\ngauge, or in other words, the area closer to the gauge than to any other gauge.  The ratio\nof the area of each polygon to the total area is the weight.  The average or weighted\nrainfall is the sum of the product of the rainfall and weight of each gauge.  P1 to Pn are\nthe rainfall at gauges 1 to n and A1 to An are the areas of the respective polygons (Fig.\n4.4).\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 22\nFig. 4.4 Theissen Polygons\nAn example for working out average rainfall using this method is shown inTable. 4.1.\nTable 4.1 Example to Work out Weighted Average Using Theissen Polygon\nMethod\nRainfall\n(mm)\nArea\n(sq km)\nWeight Weighted Average\nRainfall (mm)\n165 18 0.011 1.8\n371 311 0.192 71.2\n488 282 0.174 84.9\n683 311 0.192 131.1\n391 52 0.032 12.5\n757 238 0.147 111.3\n1270 212 0.131 166.4\n1143 197 0.121 138.3\nTotal 1",

After the occurrence of infiltration and other\nloses from the precipitation (rainfall), the excess rainfall flows out through the small\nnatural channels on the land surface to the main drainage channels. Such types of flow\nare called surface flows. A part of the infiltrated rainwater moves parallel to the land\nsurface as subsurface flow, and reappears on the surface at certain other points.  Such\nflows are called interflows. Another part of the infiltrated water percolates downwards\nto ground water and moves laterally to emerge in depression and rivers and joins the\nsurface flow.  This type of flow is called the subsurface flow or ground water flow.\n4.2.1 Hydrograph\nA pl ot of th e s tr e am di s ch a r g e a gai n s t th e el a ps ed ti m e gi v e s th e f l ow h y d r og r a p h .\nThe time scale could correspond to a storm period, a month, a season, a year or any\nother si",

The stream flows are classified as perennial, intermittent and\nephemeral.  Perennial streams always carry some water on account of replenishment\nby ground water throughout the year. Intermittent streams receive varying supplies of\nground water, which is more during the wet season and dries up in the summer.\nEphemeral streams do not get any supply of ground water and behave like storm\ndrains in which the flow occurs only due to the overland flow caused by a stream.\nThese streams cause flash floods too.\n4.2.2 Estimation of Runoff\nRunoff can be estimated by various methods. These can be classified under the\nfollowing headings:\nEmpirical formulae and tables\nRunoff Estimation based on Land Use and Treatment.\nRational Method and\nEmpirical formulae for flood peak\n4.2.2.1 Empirical Formulae and Tables\n4.2.2.1.1 Binnie's Percentages: Sir Alexander Binnie was probably among the first to\ns t u d y t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p o f r u n o f f t o r a i n f a l l w i t h a v i e w t o e x p r e s s t h e f o r m e r a s a\npercentage of the latter (Table.4.3)\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 25\nTable 4.3 Binnie’s Percentages for Computation of Runoff\nAnnual Rainfall\n(mm)\nRunoff\n(%)\nAnnual Rainfall\n(mm)\nRunoff\n(%)\n500 15 900 34\n600 21 1000 38\n700 25 1100 40\n800 29\nThe percentages are based on observations on two rivers in Madhya Pradesh.\n4.2.2.1.2 Coefficients: The runoff ‘R’ in cm and rainfall ‘P’ in cm can be correlated\na s R = K P , w h e r e ‘ K ’ i s t h e r u n of f c o e f f i c i e n t .

Land treatment applies mainly to agricultural\nland uses and includes mechanical practices such as contouring or terracing and\nmanagement practices such as grazing control or rotation of crops. The classes consist\nof use and treatment combinations actually to be found on watersheds.

A generalised soil map of India, giving the broad\nclassification of all the major soils in India is shown in Fig.4.6. Major characteristics\nof these groups are described in Table 4.10. The classification is broad but the groups\ncan be divided into sub-groups whenever such a refinement is justified.

Thus, the basic\nassumptions for development of this method were made for urban catchments.\nHowever, this method is fairly applicable to small agricultural watersheds of 40 to 80\nhectares size (Chow, 1964).\nThe Rational method is based on the assumption that constant intensity of rainfall is\nuniformly spread over an area, and the effective rain falling on the most remote part\nof the basin takes a certain period of time, known as the time of concentration (Tc) to\narrive at the basin outlet.  If the input rate of excess rainfall on the basin continues for\nth e p e ri od of ti m e of c on c en tr a ti on , th en th e p a r t of th e ex c e s s r ai n th a t f el l i n th e\nmost remote par",

That is, the maximum rate of\noutflow will occur when the rainfall duration is equal to the time of concentration.\nThe above processes are explained in Fig. 4.7. Consider a drainage basin, which has\nr a i n f a l l o f u n i f o r m i n t e n s i t y a n d o f l o n g e r d u r a t i o n . O n p l o t t i n g t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p\nbetween the cumulative runoff rate Q and time, the rate of runoff shows a gradual\nincrease from zero to a constant value.  The runoff increases with increase in flow\nfrom remote areas of the basin to its outlet. If the rainfall continues beyond the time of\nconcentration, then there is no further increase in the runoff, and it remains constant at\nits peak value.\nFig. 4.7 Runoff Hydrograph Due to Uniform Rainfall\nThe relationship for peak runoff Qp is then expressed as\nQp =   C I A\nWhere, C = coefficient of runoff\nA = area of the catchment (drainage basin)\nI   = intensity of rainfall.\nEnd of Rainfall\nRecession curve\nTc\nEnd of Rainfall\nRecession curve\nQp\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 35\nIn metric units, this equation is expressed as.\nQp =  1    C  I  A\n        3.6\nWhere, Qp = peak runoff rate (m³/s)\nC    = coefficient of runoff\nI     = mean intensity of precipitation (mm/h) for a duration equal to time of\n                     concentration, and for an accidence probability.\nA  = area of the drainage basin (km²).\n4.2.2.3.1 Runoff Coefficient Factor (C): T h e r u n o f f c o e f f i c i e n t f a c t o r ( C )\nencompasses all other factors that affect the surface runoff, except the area (A) and\nthe intensity of rainfall (I).

The average slope of the land surface is 0.006\nand the maximum travel depth of rainfall in the catchment is approximately 1.95 km.\nThe maximum depth of rainfall in the area with a return period of 25 years is as\ntabulated in Table 4.20.\nTable 4.20 Maximum Depth of Rainfall in an Area with a Return Period of 25\nYears.\nTime duration (min) 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 60\nRain fall depth (mm) 15 25 32 45 50 53 60 65\nConsider that 2.0 Km² of the catchment area has cultivated sandy loam soil (c=0.2)\nand 3.0 Km² has light clay cultivated soil (c = 0.7).  Determine the peak flow rate of\nrunoff by using the Rational method.\nSolution: The time of concentration is given by Kirpich’s equation.\nTc = 0.01947 L0.77S-0.385\n     = 0.01947 (1950) 0.77 (0.006) -0.385 min\n     = 47.65 min.\nThe maximum rainfall depth for 47.65 min duration would fall between the periods of\n40-60 min and is located at 7.65 min after the 40 min period at which the maximum\nrainfall depth is 60 mm, as per the available data.\nThe rainfall depth during the 7.65 min period  = 65-60 x 7.65 = 1.9 mm\n        20\nTherefore, for 47.65 min duration, the rainfall depth  = 60 + 1.9 = 61.9 mm.\nThe average rainfall intensity     =          maximum rainfall depth(During the period of time of concentration) Tc\n    =     61.9 x 60 =  77.96 mm/hr\n     47.65\n     Runoff coefficient, C             =          (20 x 0.2) + (3.0 x 0.7)\n5.0\n                    =              0.4 +2.  =      0.5\n5.0\nP",

Physical quality of recharge water refers\nto the type and amount of suspended solids, temperature, and the amount of entrapped\nair whereas chemical quality refers to type and concentration of dissolved solids and\ngases. Biological quality refers to type and concentration of living organisms.  Under\ncertain conditions, any or all of these characteristics can diminish recharge rates.\n4.3.1 Physical Quality\nIf suspended solids are present in the recharge water, surface application techniques\nare more efficient than subsurface techniques. Even though suspended particles may\ncause clogging, the infiltration surfaces are accessible for remedial treatment. Where\nindirect methods of recharge are used, suspended solids pose virtually no problem.\nUnder such conditions, induced recharge would probably be one of the best methods.\nDitch and furrows method is also well suited for large amounts of suspended solid\nl o a d s b e c a u s e t h e s t e a d y f l o w o f w a t e r i n h i b i t s s e t t l i n g .

If basins must be used for recharge with turbid water, they can be used in\nseries, whereby the first basin acts as a clarifier for subsequent basins.

    "recharge with turbid water, they can be used in\nseries, whereby the first basin acts as a clarifier for subsequent basins. This method\nrequires more land, however, and is feasible only where land is readily available.\nWhere suspended solid loads in recharge water are high, subsurface application\ntechniques, including deep pits, shafts, and wells, are prone to failure. Unless pre-\ntreatment measures are provided, subsurface techniques should not be considered\nwhen the source water is turbid because clogging of injection wells is particularly\ntroublesome, and well redevelopment is costly.\n4.3.2 Chemical Quality\nRecharge water should be chemically compatible with the aquifer material through\nw h i ch i t f l ows an d th e n a ti v e g r ou n d w a te r t o a v oi d ch em i cal r e a c ti on s th a t w ou l d\nreduce effective porosity and recharge capacity. Chemical precipitation and\nunfavourable exchange reactions, as well as the presence of dissolved gases, are\ncauses for concern. Cation exchange reactions involving sodium in recharge water\nmay cause clay particles to swell or disperse, thereby decreasing infiltration rate or\naquifer permeability. Dissolved gases may alter aquifer pH or come out of solution,\nforming gas pockets that occupy pore space and decrease aquifer permeability.\nToxic substances in excess of established health standards must not be present in the\nrecharge water unless they can be removed by pre-treatment or chemically\ndecomposed by a suitable land or aquifer treatment system. If artificial recharge is for\ndrinking purpose, then the source water must conform to the drinking water standards\nin vogue.\n4.3.3 Biological Quality\nBiological agents such as algae or bacteria may also be present in recharge water.\nOrganic wastes may contain harmful bacteria or promote their growth and decay or\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 40\norganic materials may produce excess nitrate or other by-products. Growth of algae\nand bacteria during",
    "r promote their growth and decay or\nSource Water\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 40\norganic materials may produce excess nitrate or other by-products. Growth of algae\nand bacteria during recharge can cause clogging of infiltration surfaces and may lead\nto the production of gases that further hinder recharge efforts. Although surface\nspreading removes most bacteria and algae by filtration before the recharge water\nreaches the aquifer, surface clogging can reduce the infiltration rate considerably.\nInjection of water containing bacteria and algae through wells is generally not\nrecommended because it causes clogging of well screens or aquifer materials, which\nis difficult and costly to remedy.\nThe quality of source water is thus vitally important wherever direct recharge\ntechniques are contemplated. In cases where insitu precipitation or water supplied\nfrom canals are used for recharge, no constraints on account of water quality may\narise. However, in cases where waters in the lower reaches of rivers or recycled\nmunicipal/industrial waste waters are proposed to be used, the quality of water\nrequires to be precisely analysed and monitored to determine the type and extent of\ntreatment required.\nIn cases where the recharge is contemplated through spreading techniques, raw waste\nwater can be used after primary sedimentation and secondary (biological) treatment to\ntake advantage of filtration and bio-degradation that occurs as the water passes\nthrough the upper soil layers and zone of aeration. On the other hand, if the water is to\nbe used for direct recharge, secondary treatment should be followed by chemical\nclarification (coagulation-flocculation-clarification). The water is then allowed to pass\nthrough adequate filter beds. The filtration is followed by tertiary treatment involving\nair tripping, granular activated carbon treatment, reverse osmosis and disinfection, in\nthat order.\nThe consideration of chemical quality of source water will thus lead to decis",
    "ry treatment involving\nair tripping, granular activated carbon treatment, reverse osmosis and disinfection, in\nthat order.\nThe consideration of chemical quality of source water will thus lead to decisions\nabout the extent and type of treatment required, arrangements for treatment plants and\nthe cost of source water. In case it is not possible to ensure the desired quality\nstandard from the treatment, such source(s) may be avoided for recharging the ground\nwater.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 41\n5. PLANNING OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE SCHEMES\nProper planning is essential for the successful outcome of any artificial recharge\nscheme. Planning of artificial recharge schemes involves the formulation of a suitable\nplan, under a given set of natural conditions, to augment the natural ground water\nrecharge. An artificial recharge scheme may be aimed at recharge augmentation in a\nspecific area for making up the shortage in ground water recharge compared to the\nground water draft either fully or partially.\nThe area involved in artificial recharge projects may range from a watershed, a\nlimited area covering an urban, rural or industrial centre or administrative units like\nMandal/Block to large basins or larger administrative units like Districts/States.\nThough the steps involved in planning are essentially the same, the planning is done\non different scales as per the required objectives and the area involved. Thus,\nplanning of recharge scheme may be done at Mega level (State or Basin level), Macro\nlevel (District or sub-basin level) and Micro level (Block or Watershed level) at\nprogressively larger scales. It is advisable to do State/Basin level planning at 1:\n2000,000 scale, District / Sub-basin level planning at 1:250,000 scale and Block /\nWatershed level planning at 1:50,000 scale and so on.\nProper scientific investigations aimed at assessing the need and feasibility of an area\nfor artificial recharge are necessary prerequi",

The most important considerations in this\nregard are described in brief in the following sections.\n5.1.1 Establishing the Need\nAssessing the need for recharge augmentation in a scientific and objective manner\nforms the first step in planning a recharge scheme. Artificial recharge may be required\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 42\nfor tiding over deficit situations in summer/winter seasons though sufficient water\nmay be available for the year as a whole, or to combat perennial deficit situations\ngetting compounded over the years.

In the former case, there is need for building up\na d d i t i o n a l g r o u n d w a t e r s t o r a g e a s a n d w h e n i t i s a v a i l a b l e a n d t o c o n s e r v e i t t o\nensure that the available supplies last through the lean season. In case where the\nground water deficit gets compounded due to overexploitation, artificial recharge\nmeasures will often have to be coupled with economy measures for preventing misuse\nof water and regulation of ground water development through legislation for them to\nbe effective.\nThe need for artificial recharge also requires to be prioritized according to its\nimportance in the overall development perspective of the nation. Such prioritization\nwill also help in deciding the economic viability of the scheme being contemplated.\nRecharge for catering to drinking water needs in adverse situations, preventive\nrecharge to combat saline water ingress/land subsidence and augmentation of water\nsupply to projects of strategic importance fall under the highest priority. A benefit\ncost ratio of 0.9: 1 or even less may be acceptable depending upon the conditions\nunder which the project is being implemented. Providing subsistence irrigation in\nsemi-arid and drought-prone areas comes under the next category where a benefit cost\nratio of 1 may be considered adequate. Recharge augmentation for industrial use and\nirrigation augmentation in humid areas have the least priority and a benefit cost ratio\nof 1.5:1 or higher may be required in such situations.\nIn cases where the objective of recharge is replenishment of de-saturated aquifer\nzones or to arrest/reverse decline in ground water levels, the benefit cannot be directly\nreflected in terms of BC ratio as the benefits are mostly intangible. In such cases, a\nlong-term declining trend of ground water levels, in the absence of significant\nnegative departure of rainfall, may be attributed to",
    "f BC ratio as the benefits are mostly intangible. In such cases, a\nlong-term declining trend of ground water levels, in the absence of significant\nnegative departure of rainfall, may be attributed to over-development of ground water\nresources. Data pertaining to a period of at least 10 years is recommended for\nexamining the trend of ground water levels in an area.\n5.1.2 Estimation of Sub-surface Storage Capacity of Aquifers\nThe scope for artificial recharge in an area is basically governed by the thickness of\nunsaturated material available above the water table in the unconfined aquifer. Depth\nto water level, therefore, provides the reference level to calculate the volume of\nunsaturated material available for recharge. Depth to water level recorded during post-\nmonsoon period is used for the purpose as areas where the natural recharge is not\nenough to compensate the ground water withdrawal, can be easily identified using the\nwater level data. The average water levels for a period of at least 5 years is to be used\nin order to nullify the effects of variation in rainfall.\nContour maps prepared from the average post-monsoon water level data with suitable\ncontour intervals can be used for assessment of available storage space. The inter-\ncontour areas between successive contours are determined and the total area in which\nthe water levels are below a certain cut-off level (say 3.00 m.bgl in phreatic aquifers),\nmultiplied by the specific yield of the aquifer material gives the volume of sub-\nsurface storage space available for recharge. The cut-off water level is so selected to\nensure that the recharge does not result in water logging conditions in the area.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 43\nAfter assessing the subsurface storage space, the actual requirement of source water is\nto be estimated.

Based on the experience gained from field experiments, the average\nrecharge efficiency of the individual structure is to be specified (say 60-90%). To\narrive at the total volume of actual source water required at the surface, the volume of\nwater required for artificial recharge is calculated by multiplying the volume of sub-\nsurface storage space with the reciprocal of recharge efficiency of the structure\nproposed.\nSample worksheets for estimation of sub-surface storage capacity and volume of\nwater required for recharge is shown in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 respectively.\nTable 5.1 Sample Worksheet for Estimation of Sub-surface Storage Capacity\nSl.\nNo.\nBasin Water-\nshed\nGeographi-\ncal area\n(sq.km)\nArea\nidentified\nfor\nartificial\nrecharge\n(sq.km)\nDepth to\nwater\nlevel\n(Post-\nmonsoon)\nbelow\ncut-off\nlevel\n(m)\nVolume of\nunsaturated\nzone\n(M Cu m)\nAverage\nspecific\nyield\n(%)\nTotal\nsubsurface\nstorage\npotential as\nvolume of\nwater (M Cu\nm)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7= (5x6) 8 9=(7x8)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTable 5.2 Sample Worksheet for Estimation of Volume of Water Required for\nRecharge\nSl.\nNo\nBasin / Sub\nbasin /\nWatershed\nArea\nIdentified\nfor Artificial\nRecharge*\n(Sq.km)\nSub surface\nStorage\nPotential**\n(M Cu m)\nRecharge\nEfficiency\n(%)\nSurface Water\nRequirement\n(M Cu m)\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)=(4 )x 100 / (5)\n1\n2\n3\n*As in column 5 & ** column 9 of Table 5.1\n5.1.3 Prioritisation of Areas for Artificial Recharge\nIt may not always be possible to implement artificial recharge projects in the entire\narea even though the need is established, due to various constraints such as lack of\nsource water, shortage of funds for implementation of the projects etc. In such cases,\nit may be necessary to identify areas that require recharge augmentation most and to\nimplement recharge projects accordingly.\nPrioritisation of areas for artificial recharge is normally done by overlaying post-\nm o n s o o n d e p t h t o w a t e r l e v e l m a p s w i t h m",

From these maps, it is possible to demarcate areas with various\ncombinations of depth to water levels and water level trends. For example, if a depth\nto water level map having 3 m contour intervals is combined with a water level trend\nmap with 0.1 m/year contour interval, it is possible to demarcate areas having\na) water levels in the range of 3 to 6 m.bgl and declining trend of 0.10 to 0.20\nm/year.\nb) water levels deeper than 9.00 m bgl and declining trend in excess of 0.40\nm/year or\nc) water levels deeper than 12.00 m bgl, but with a long term rising trend of 0.2\nto 0.4 m/year.\nd) Water levels in the range of 5.0 to 10.0m with declining trends during both\npre-monsoon and post-monsoon season.\nNormally, areas having deeper water levels and declining water level trends are given\nhigher priority identification of area feasible for artificial recharge. Areas having\nshallow water levels / rising water level trends are not considered for inclusion in\nartificial recharge plan.\n5.1.4 Availability of Source Water\nA realistic assessment and quantificati on of the source water hel p design the storage\ncapacity of the structure. Otherwise, there is a possibility of arriving at an improper\ndesign of the recharge structure. Various aspects of assessment of source water\navailability have been dealt with in the chapter on ‘Source Water’.

The quality aspects of the water to be utilized for recharge needs to be\nascertained from the available data and if required through detailed analysis.\n5.1.5 Suitability of Area for Recharge\nThe climatic, topographic, soil, land-use and hydrogeologic conditions are important\nfactors controlling the suitability of an area for artificial recharge. The climatic\nconditions broadly determine the spatial and temporal availability of water for\nrecharge, whereas the topography controls the extent of run-off and retention. The\nprevalent soil and land use conditions determine the extent of infiltration, whereas the\nhydrogeologic conditions govern the occurrence of potential aquifer systems and their\nsuitability for artificial recharge.\n5.1.5.1 Climatic Conditions\nIn regions experiencing high (1000 to 2000 mm/year) to very high (>2000 mm/year)\nrainfall, such as the Konkan and Malabar coasts, North-eastern States, parts of lesser\nHimalayas in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, eastern part of Madhya Pradesh\na n d pa r ts of Bi h a r an d B en g al , a m aj or p a r t of th e w a te r r e c ei v e d d u ri n g th e r ai ny\ns e a s o n g o e s a s s u r f a c e r u n o f f .

In areas of very high rainfall, the phenomenon of rejected recharge\nmay also occur.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 45\nM os t of s uch areas m ay n ot requi re arti fi ci al rech arge of groun d water an d th e b es t\noption is to store as much of the surplus water available as possible in large surface\nreservoirs, to be  released to downstream areas during non-monsoon periods for direct\nuse or to be used as source water for artificial recharge in suitable a",
    "ter available as possible in large surface\nreservoirs, to be  released to downstream areas during non-monsoon periods for direct\nuse or to be used as source water for artificial recharge in suitable areas. The second\nand third order streams in such regions may have flow throughout the winter and the\nmajor rivers are normally perennial.  The water in these streams and rivers, diverted,\nlifted or drawn through induced recharge may also be used as source water for\nartificial recharge.\nIn areas having moderate rainfall (750 – 1000 mm/year) such as eastern parts of\nPunjab and Maharashtra, eastern and central parts of Madhya Pradesh, parts of\nGodavari delta, eastern coast and Karnataka, adequate ground water resources are\ngenerally available only during the rainy season. A major component of the\nprecipitation goes as surface runoff in these areas too and recharge may be 10 to 15\npercent of annual precipitation. Ground water recharge is normally not sufficient to\nsaturate the water table aquifers in deficit rainfall years. The second and third order\nstreams normally do not have any flow during a major part of winter and only major\nstreams may have some flow during summer.\nThe non-availability of surplus runoff beyond the rainy season may impose a severe\nconstraint on artificial recharge to ground water in these areas. Diversion of water\nreleased from surface water reservoirs in the upper reaches of the catchments, water\ntransferred from surplus basins or lifted from rivers wherever available may be\nrequired for sustaining irrigation water supplies. Hence, conserving as much of\nsurface runoff as possible through watershed treatment measures, inducing additional\nrecharge during and after rainy season and conserving ground water outflow through\nsubsurface dykes may be suitable for such areas.\nIn semi-arid regions with low to moderate rainfall in the range of 400 to 700 mm/year,\nthe annual precipitation may not even suffice to meet the existing water demand, and\ndroughts may o",

The evapotranspiration losses in these areas are quite high and even\nthough 15 to 20 percent of water gets infiltrated into the ground, the total ground\nwater recharge will be limited because of the low rainfall. The stream flow in these\nregions is mostly restricted to the rainy season.\nThe replenishment of aquifers during rainy season generally is not enough to cater to\nthe irrigation requirements during Rabi season in such areas, though it may be\nadequate for drinking water use through winter. Shortage of drinking water supplies is\ncommon during summer, which may be acute in years of deficit rainfall. Though\nrecharge augmentation is warranted, due to lack of availability of source water, the\nonly option available is to conserve as much of the surplus surface runoff during the\nshort rainy season. Rainwater harvesting and runoff conservation measures for\naugmenting the ground water resources are appropriate in such situations.\nIn areas falling in arid zone, such as western Rajasthan desert, parts of Kutch region\nof Gujarat and Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, the annual precipitation is less\nthan 400 mm, the number of rainy days between 20 and 30 or even less and the\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 46\ncoefficient of variation of rainfall is normally between 30 and 70 percent. The major\ncomponent of outflow is evaporation and drainage is poorly developed in these areas.\nI n f i l t r a t i o n o f w a t e r m a y",

Such areas may be left out of consideration\nfor artificial recharge in spite of need unless trans-basin water is available. Rainwater\nharvesting may be contemplated in such regions for augmenting drinking water\nsupplies. In case imported water is available, spreading or injection methods (for\nconfined aquifers) may be considered depending on surface conditions (sandy/rocky),\ntopographic set-up and salinity profiles of soils and the zone of aeration.\n5.1.5.2 Topographic Set-up\nThe topographic set-up of an area controls the retention period of surface and ground\nwater within a topographic unit. The gradients are very steep (more than 1:10) in the\nrunoff zones, with very little possibility of infiltration. Such areas on hill-slopes may\nbe suitable only for water conservation measures like gully plugging, bench terracing\nor contour trenching, aimed at slowing down surface runoff and thereby causing more\ninfiltration, which may go as delayed subsurface seepage either to the unconfined or\ndeeper confined aquifer systems.\nModerate topographic slopes between 1:10 and 1:100 usually occur on valley sides,\ndownward of piedmont foothill regions. Surface and subsurface retention of water in\nthese areas will be for longer durations depending upon slope and other conditions.\nThe piedmont zone, with characteristically deep water table is located immediately at\nthe foothills. The surface drainage is generally located above the water table. The se\nareas are suitable for locating recharge basins and percolation ponds for recharging\nthe water table aquifer. These unconfined aquifers may or may not recharge the\ndeeper aquifers depending upon their hydraulic c",
    "itable for locating recharge basins and percolation ponds for recharging\nthe water table aquifer. These unconfined aquifers may or may not recharge the\ndeeper aquifers depending upon their hydraulic connectivity. At elevations just below\nthe piedmont zone, artificial recharge through percolation ponds, recharge pits,\ntrenches and recharge basins is normally feasible. In this transition zone, the\npiezometric heads of deeper aquifers may be initially located below the phreatic\nsurface but at lower elevations, the situation may be the reverse. In the former\nsituation, recharge of deeper aquifers through shafts, gravity inflow wells or injection\nwells may be feasible if sufficient source water supply is available.\nThe broad valley floors or the zone of lowest elevation occurring along the major\nrivers may typically have gentle to very gentle gradients. The movement of both\nsurface and ground water in these areas is sluggish and retention time, in general, is\nhigh. These areas are generally categorized as ground water storage zones as all the\nwater moving down the water table gradient converges in this zone. The deeper semi-\nconfined aquifers often contribute water to the unconfined zone through upward\nleakage due to higher piezometric heads.

    "3 Soil and Land Use Conditions\nSoil and land use conditions are of vital importance if artificial recharge through\nsurface spreading methods is contemplated in an area. Various factors such as the\ndepth of soil profile, its texture, mineral composition and organic content control the\ninfiltration capacity of soils. Areas having a thin soil cover are easily drained and\np e rm i t m or e i n f i l tr a ti on wh en c om p a r e d to a r e a s wi th th i c k s oi l c ov e r i n th e v al l ey\nzones. Soils having coarser texture due to higher sand-silt fractions have markedly\nhigher infiltration capacity as compared to clay-rich soils, which are poorly\npermeable. Soils containing minerals, which swell on wetting like montmorillonite\netc. and with higher organic matter, are good retainers of moisture necessary for crop\ngrowth but impede deeper percolation.\nThe land use and extent of vegetation also controls the infiltration capacity of soils.\nB a r r e n v a l l e y s l o p e s a r e p o o r r e t a i n e r s o f w a t e r a s c o m p a r e d t o g r a s s l a n d s a n d\nforested tracts, which not only hold water on the surface longer, but also facilitate\nseepage during the rainy seasons through the root systems. Similarly, ploughed fields\nfacilitate more infiltration as compared to barren fields.\n5.1.5.4 Hydrogeological Factors\nHydrogeological conditions of the area are also among important factors in planning\nartificial recharge schemes. The recharged water moves below the soil zone in\nmoisture fronts through the zone of aeration. The unsaturated flow is governed by the\npermeability of zone of aeration, which in turn varies with moisture content of the\nf r o n t .

The hydrogeologic properties of the weathered strata are generally much better\nas compared to the parent rock due to higher porosity and permeability imparted by\nweathering.  The nature of soil, subsoil, weathered mantle, presence of hard pans or\nimpermeable layers govern the process of recharge into the unconfined aquifer. The\nsaturation and movement of ground water within unconfined and all deeper semi-\nconfined and confined aquifers is governed by storativity and hydraulic conductivity\nof the aquifer material. Aquifers best suited for artificial recharge are those, which\nabsorb large quantities of water and release them whenever required.\nThe geologic formations encountered in India have been classified into three groups\nbased on their hydrogeologic properties and ground water potential. The broad\nhydrogeological characteristics of each group and the suitability of artificial recharge\nmethods in each are given in Tables 5.3 . The geologic formations in the highly\nmountainous Himalayan Region, except for the Quaternary valley fill deposits have\nn o t b e e n c o v e r e d i n t h i s c l a s s i f i c a t i o n o n a c c o u n t o f t h e a d v e r s e t o p o g r a p h i c\nconditions.

    ".2 Investigations for Proper Planning\nVarious inputs are necessary for proper and scientific planning of artificial recharge\nschemes in any terrain. Scientific investigations leading to a better understanding of\nthe characteristics of sub-surface formations are to be taken up for realistic\ndetermination of these inputs. These can broadly be grouped into two categories\nnamely viz. general studies and detailed studies.\n5.2.1 General Studies\nThese studies are aimed at assessing the need and scope of artificial recharge in an\narea. The procedure to be followed for establishing the need for artificial recharge in\nan area to augment the ground water resources has already been described in detail in\nan earlier section of the chapter.\nOnce a case of overexploitation of ground water is proved, the need for augmentation\nof ground water resources through artificial recharge is justified. In case of entire\nwatersheds, overlaying of maps depicting the long-term decline in water levels and\ncumulative departure of rainfall from the normal can help in identification of areas\nrequiring recharge augmentation.\nOnce the areas requiring artificial recharge are identified, the next step is to decide on\nthe appropriate techniques for recharging the aquifer. The synthesis of all available\ndata relevant to ground water is the first step in this exercise. These data include a) all\nsources of recharge like rivers, tanks, canals etc., b) rainfall distribution pattern, c)\nhydrogeological parameters with emphasis on lithological characteristics, d) nature of\nthe terrain, e) intensity of ground water development and irrigation practices and f)\nchemical quality of surface and ground water etc. The data is generally available in\nreports/records of various Central and State Government agencies.

    "the data\navailable often have considerable gaps. It is therefore necessary to have detailed\nstudies to supplement the available data and for preparation of a scientific data base\nfor proper implementation of suitable artificial recharge schemes.\n5.2.2 Detailed Studies\nOnce the need for and suitability of the area for artificial recharge to ground water are\nidentified on the basis of data collected from the general studies, areas identified as\nsuitable for recharge augmentation are studied in detail using Remote Sensing\ntechniques and through hydrometeorological, hydrological, geophysical,\nhydrogeological and hydrochemical investigations to ascertain the scope and\nfeasibili ty of artificial recharge. These studi es are to be ori ented in such a way as to\ncollect and analyse necessary data, which are to be used as inputs for proper planning\nof artificial recharge projects. The major inputs expected to be provided by the studies\nmentioned are given below (Table 5.4)\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 53\nTable.5.4 Details of Studies Required for Planning Artificial Recharge Schemes\nSl.No Type of Study Inputs Anticipated\n1 Remote Sensing Studies\nSpatial variation in the infiltration\ncharacteristics of various litho-units.\nDrainage characteristics and Lineament\nintensity.\nDistribution of various geomorphic units.\n2 Hydrometeorological Studies Rainfall amount, duration, daily and hourly\nrainfall intensity, variability of rainfall.\n3 Hydrological Studies\nSource water availability, infiltration\ncharacteristics of major soil types and\nvarious land use categories\n4 Geophysical Studies\nThickness of weathered zone in hard rocks\nThickness and characteristics of granular\nzones in sedimentary terrain.\nStratification of aquifer system and spatial\nvariability in hydraulic conductivity.\nVertical hydraulic conductivity\nDiscontinuities such as dykes and fault\nzones.\n5 Hydrogeological Studies\nRegional hydrogeology and aquifer\ncharacteri",

Satellite data provides quick and useful baseline information\non various parameters controlling the occurrence and movement of ground water such\nas geology, structural features, geomorphology, soils, land use, land cover, lineaments\netc. All these parameters used to be studied earlier independently due to non-\navailability of data and lack of integrating tools and modeling techniques.

Aspects, which\nare given special attention for the study, usually carried out with Satellite Imagery or\nFalse Colour Composites (FCC) on 1: 50,000 scale include stream course delineation,\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 54\nland form analysis, outcrop pattern analysis, fracture pattern analysis and land use\nanalysis.

    "d form analysis, outcrop pattern analysis, fracture pattern analysis and land use\nanalysis. These studies can provide valuable information on drainage density and\nlineament intensity, which helps in the identification of suitable sites for recharge.\nVarious geomorphic units can also be delineated, which also help determine the type\nof recharge structures suitable for the area.\nApart from visual interpretation, digital image enhancement techniques are also being\nincreasingly used for deriving geological, structural and geomorphological\ninformation. Digital Image Enhancement techniques are found to be extremely useful\nas they improve the feature sharpness and contrast for simple interpretation. Various\nthematic layers generated using remote sensing data such as lithology, structure,\ngeomorphology, land use/land cover, lineaments etc. can be integrated with slope,\ndrainage density and other collateral data in a Geographic Information System (GIS)\nframework and analysed using a model developed with logical conditions to arrive at\nsuitable sites for artificial recharge.\nImage rectification and preparation of a GIS file through visual interpretation of\nstandard False Color Composite (FCC) data can be done to extract expressions of sub-\nsurface moisture conditions. Techniques such as Edge Enhancement are Band\nRationing are useful techniques for digital image interpretation.\nObservations from satellite data must be complemented by field checks, existing\ngeologic maps and topographic sheets.\n5.2.2.2 Hydrometeorological Studies\nRainfall and evaporation are two of the most important parameters, which are\nrequired for proper planning of artificial recharge schemes.\nDetailed information pertaining to the amount, duration and intensity of rainfall in a\ngiven area is a necessary pre-requisite for planning recharge schemes.

Rainfall data is\nnormally available at offices of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Revenue\nOffices such as Collectorates, Taluk/Block/Mandal offices, Irrigation project dam\nsites and Agricultural Universities/ Colleges etc.\nLong-term average rainfall is an important parameter for assessing the storage\ncapacity of various artificial recharge structures. On the other hand, daily and hourly\nrainfall data is essential for planning water conservation schemes such as farm ponds,\ncontour trenches, roof top rainwater harvesting schemes and also for designing filters\nfor runoff recharge schemes.\nLong-term average rainfall, dependable average rainfall and probability of incidence\nof a p a r ti c ul a r am ou n t of r ai n f al l i n a gi v en a r e a c a n b e c al c ul a te d u s i n g l on g - te rm\nrainfall data of IMD Stations for 100 to 150 years. For computations of daily and\nhourly rainfall intensity, data available with other agencies can be used.\nEvaporation data is useful for assessing the potential losses from the free surfaces of\nponds and other surface water storage structures. Data related to daily/seasonal/\nmonthly evaporation losses is helpful for identification of most effective recharge\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 55\nschemes in an area. The period/duration of ground water recharge with minimum\nevaporation losses can be determined from this data.\n5.2.2.3 Hydrological Studies\nHydrological investigations are useful for ascertaining the availability of source water\nfor recharge. These investigations are required to be carried out in the watershed, sub-\nbasin or basin where the artificial recharge schemes are envisaged.\nA detailed account of the hydrological investigations for artificial recharge schemes\nhave already been discussed under the heading ‘Source Water' earlier in the manual.\n5.2.2.4 Geophysical Studies\nGeophysical studies can provide useful informat",
    "igations for artificial recharge schemes\nhave already been discussed under the heading ‘Source Water' earlier in the manual.\n5.2.2.4 Geophysical Studies\nGeophysical studies can provide useful information pertaining to the characteristics of\nsub-surface lithological formations, which influence the type of recharge mechanism\nsuitable for a particular area. These studies are normally taken up to complement the\ndata collected through hydrogeological investigations.\nThe main purpose of applying geophysical methods for the selection of appropriate\nsites for artificial recharge studies is to assess the unknown sub-surface\nhydrogeological conditions economically, adequately and unambiguously. They are\nusually employed to narrow down the target zone and to pinpoint the probable sites\nfor artificial recharge structures. The application of geophysical techniques is also\nuseful for bringing out a comparative picture of the sub-surface litho-environment and\nto correlate them with the hydrogeological setting. Besides defining the sub-surface\nstructure and lithology, geophysical studies can also help in studies for identifying the\nbrackish/fresh ground water interface, contaminated zones (saline) and area prone to\nseawater intrusion.\nIn the context of artificial recharge, Geophysical studies are particularly useful for\ngathering information pertaining to\ni. Stratification of aquifer systems and spatial variability of hydraulic\nconductivity of different zones.\nii. Negative or non-productive zones of low hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated\nand saturated zones.\niii. Vertical hydraulic conductivity discontinuities such as dykes, faults etc.\niv. Moisture movement and infiltration.\nv. Direction of ground water flow under natural/artificial recharge processes.\nvi.

Physical parameters like rock resistivities, magnetic\nsusceptibilities, shock wave velocities etc. are measured in these investigations and\ninterpreted to gather information pertaining to sub-surface rock types, rock water\ncontent, structural controls on ground water movement and ground water salinity.\nSubsurface methods such as Spontaneous Potential, Neutron, Natural Gamma, and\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 56\nClosed Circuit Television (CCTV) logging techniques are also useful for collecting\nvaluable information from boreholes in the study area. As compared to surface\nmethods, which measure parameter values representative of a combined subsurface\nlayer sequence, subsurface methods measure the value of the physical parameter\nconcerned for each individual layer.\n5.2.2.5 Hydrogeological Studies\nA detailed understanding of the hydrogeology of the area is of prime importance in\nensuring successful implementation of any artificial recharge scheme. A desirable\nfirst step toward achieving this objective is to synthesize all available data on various\nhydrogeological parameters from different agencies. Regional geological maps\nindicate the location of different geological strata, their geological age sequence,\nboundaries/contacts of individual formations and structural expressions like strike,\ndip, faults, folds, fractures, intrusive bodies etc. These maps also indicate the\ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts.\nMaps providing information on regional hydrogeological units, their ground water\npotential and general pattern of ground water fl",
    "ate the\ncorrelation of topography and drainage to geological contacts.\nMaps providing information on regional hydrogeological units, their ground water\npotential and general pattern of ground water flow and chemical quality of ground\nwater in different aquifers are also necessary. Satellite imagery provide useful data on\ngeomorphic units and lineaments, which govern the occurrence and movement of\nground water, especially in hard rock terrain. A detailed hydrogeological study, aimed\nat supplementing the regional picture of hydrogeological set up available from\nprevious studies, is imperative to have precise information about the promising\nhydrogeological units for recharge and to decide on the location and type of structures\nto be constructed.\n5.2.2.5.1 Detailed Hydrogeological Mapping: The purpose of detailed\nhydrogeological mapping is to prepare the following maps, which facilitate an\nunderstanding of the ground water regime and its suitability to artificial recharge\nschemes\ni) Map showing the hydrogeological units demarcated on the basis of their\nwater-bearing capabilities, both at shallow and deep levels.\nii) Map showing ground water elevation contours to determine the form of\nthe water table and the hydraulic connection between ground water and\nsurface water bodies like rivers, tanks and canals.\niii) Maps showing depths to water table, usually compiled for the periods of\nmaximum, minimum and mean annual positions of water table.\niv) Maps showing amplitudes of ground water level fluctuation.\nv) M aps sh owi n g pi ezom etri c h eads of aquif ers an d th ei r vari ati ons wi th\ntime.\nvi) Maps showing ground water potentials of different hydrogeological\nunits and the levels of ground water development.\nvii) Maps showing chemical quality of ground water in different aquifers.\nThe usage of the above interpretative maps is additive, i.e., their combined usage\nprovides greater knowledge and understanding of an area than when a map is used in\nisolation.

For surface water spreading techniques, the area of interest is generally restricted\nto shallow depths. The main stress is on knowing whether the surface rock types are\nsufficiently permeable to maintain high rate of infiltration during artificial recharge.\n5.2.2.6 Hydrochemical Studies\nA detailed study of the quality of source water is vitally important whenever direct\nrecharge techniques are contemplated. In cases where  in situ  precipitation or water\nsupplied from canals are used for recharge, no constraints on account of water quality\nmay arise. However, in cases where waters in the lower reaches of rivers or recycled\nmunicipal/industrial waste waters are proposed to be used, the quality of water\nrequires to be precisely analysed and monitored to determine the type and extent of\ntreatment required.\n5.3 Appraisal of Economic Viability\nEconomic viability is another critical parameter to be ascertained before taking a\ndecision to implement any artificial recharge scheme.

The appraisal of economic\nviability has to be carried out after taking into account all possible expenses including\nthose for investigation, source water (conveyance, treatment), construction of\nrecharge structures, operation and maintenance etc. All benefits should be\nappropriately accounted for and assessed in order to decide the acceptability of the\nscheme as per its priority in the overall scheme of development.\nImportant guidelines for carrying out economic appraisal of ground water recharge\nprojects are furnished below:\ni. The inputs and outputs should be distinguished as ‘tradables’ and ‘non-\ntradables’.\nii. It is to be assumed that the project under consideration will not change the\nprice of the output.\niii. Certain adjustments have to be made for converting financial prices to\neconomic prices by applying appropriate conversion factors.\niv. The economic analysis should consider the effects of the project on both the\nproducer and the user.\nv. Labour and wages under skilled and unskilled categories have a special\nsignificance in the valuation for economic analysis. The real contribution to\nthe economy probably varies according to region, type of labour and season.\nHence, an extensive labour market survey is required for proper restructuring\nof the analysis.\nPlanning of Artificial Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 58\nvi. Although the computational part of the appraisal is rather straightforward, the\nessential purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the project has a positive\nimpact on the efficient application of the resources of the nation.\nvii.

Costs are related to\ninvestments occurring during the lifetime of the project. Benefits, on the other hand,\noriginate from the productive use of the projects. Both costs and benefits are,\ntherefore, expressed in quantitative terms and translated into monetary terms by using\nmarket values of the inputs and outputs concerned. As the costs and benefits occur at\ndifferent points of time, it is customary to express both in terms of their present value\nby applying appropriate discounting factors to make them comparable. After\naccounting for both costs and benefits against their market values, appropriate criteria\nare applied to determine the profitability of the project.\nThe benefit cost analysis of projects, also called Project Appraisal is done before the\ndecision is taken to invest.

Changes brought about by physical, chemical and bacteriological influences\nduring the process of infiltration are also important in this regard.\nImportant considerations in the selection of sites for artificial recharge through\nsurface spreading techniques include\ni) The area should have gently sloping land without gullies or ridges.\nii) The aquifer being recharged should be unconfined, permeable and\nsufficiently thick to provide storage space.\niii) The surface soil should be permeable and have high infiltration rate.\niv) Vadose zone should be permeable and free from clay lenses.\nv) Ground water levels in the phreatic zone should be deep enough to\naccommodate the recharged water so that there is no water logging.\nvi) The aquifer material should have moderate hydraulic conductivity so\nthat the recharged water is retained for sufficiently long periods in the\naquifer and can be used when needed.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water",

The schematics of a typical flooding system are shown in\nFig.6.2. To ensure proper contact time and water spread, embankments are provided\non two sides to guide the unutilized surface water to a return canal to carry the excess\nwater to the stream or canal.\nFlooding method helps reduce the evaporation losses from the surface water system,\nis the least expensive of all artificial recharge methods available and has very low\nmaintenance costs\n6.2.1.2 Ditch and Furrows method\nThis method involves construction of shallow, flat-bottomed and closely spaced\nditches or furrows to provide maximum water contact area for recharge from source\nstream or canal. The ditches should have adequate slope to maintain flow velocity and\nminimum deposition of sediments. The widths of the ditches are typically in the range\nof 0.30 to 1.80 m. A collecting channel to convey the excess water back to the source\nstream or canal should also be provided. A typical system is shown in Fig. 6.3(a) and\nthree common patterns viz. lateral ditch pattern, dendritic pattern and contour pattern\nare shown in Fig.6.3 (b). Though this technique involves less soil preparation when\ncompared to recharge basins and is less sensitive to silting, the water contact area\nseldom exceeds 10 percent of the total recharge area.\nFig.6.2 Schematics of a Typical Flood Recharge System\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 6",

They can also be constructed parallel to canals or surface water sources. In\nalluvial areas, multiple recharge basins can be constructed parallel to the streams\n(Fig.6.4), with a view to a) increase the water contact time, b) reduce suspended\nmaterial as water flows from one basin to another and c) to facilitate periodic\nmaintenance such as scraping of silt etc. to restore the infiltration rates by bypassing\nthe basin under restoration.\nFig 6.4 Schematics of a Typical Recharge Basin\nIn addition to the general design guidelines mentioned, other factors to be considered\nwhile constructing recharge basins include\na) area selected for recharge should have gentle ground slope.\nb) the entry and exit points for water should be diagonally opposite to\nfacilitate adequate water circulation in individual basins,\nc) water released into the basins should be as sediment – free as possible and\nd)  rate of inflow into the basin should be slightly more than the infiltration\ncapacity of all the basins.\n6.2.2 Runoff Conservation Structures\nThese are normally multi-purpose measures, mutually complementary and conducive\nto soil and water conservation, afforestation and increased agricultural productivity.\nThey are suitable in areas receiving low to moderate rainfall mostly during a single\nmonsoon season and having little or no scope for tran",

The structures commonly used are bench terracing, contour bunds, gully\nplugs, nalah bunds, check dams and percolation ponds.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 65\n6.2.2.1 Bench Terracing\nBench terracing involves leveling of sloping lands with surface gradients up to 8\npercent and having adequate soil cover for bringing them under irrigation. It helps in\nsoil conservation and holding runoff water on the terraced area for longer durations,\nleading to increased infiltration and ground water recharge.\nFor implementing terracing, a map of the watershed should be prepared by level\nsurveying and suitable benchmarks fixed. A contour map of 0.3 m contour interval is\nthen prepared. Depending on the land slope, the width of individual terrace should be\ndetermined, which, in no case, should be less than 12 m. The upland slope between\ntwo terraces should not be more than 1:10 and the terraces should be leveled. The\nvertical elevation difference and width of terraces are controlled by the land slope.\nThe soil and weathered rock thickness required, vertical elevation difference and the\ndistance between the bunds of two terraces for different slope categories are furnished\nin Table.6.1.\nIn cases where there is a possibility of diverting surface runoff from local drainage for\nirrigation, as required in case of paddy cultivation in high rainfall areas, outlet\nchannels of adequate dimensions are to be provided.

They derive their names from the construction of bunds along\ncontours of equal land elevation.

Elevation contours, preferably of 0.3 m interval\nare then drawn, leaving out areas not requiring bunding such as habitations, drainage\netc. The alignment of bunds should then be marked on the map.\nThe important design aspects of contour bunds are i) spacing, ii) cross section and iii)\ndeviation freedom to go higher or lower than the contour bund elevation for better\nalignment on undulating land.\n6.2.2.2.1 Spacing of Bunds: Spacing of contour bund is commonly expressed in terms\nof vertical interval (V.I), which is defined as the difference in elevation between two\nsimilar points on two consecutive bunds. The main criterion for spacing of bunds is to\nintercept the water before it attains the erosive velocity. Spacing depends on slope, soil,\nrainfall, cropping pattern and conservation practices.\nSpacing of contour bunds is normally calculated using the formula\nVertica",
    "before it attains the erosive velocity. Spacing depends on slope, soil,\nrainfall, cropping pattern and conservation practices.\nSpacing of contour bunds is normally calculated using the formula\nVertical Interval (V.I) = 0.305 (XS+Y),  where\nX is the rainfall factor,\nS  is the land slope (%) and\nY is the factor based on soil infiltration and crop cover during the\nerosive period of rains\nThe rainfall factor ‘X’ is taken as 0.80 for scanty rainfall regions with annual rainfall\nbelow 625 mm, as 0.60 for moderate rainfall regions with annual rainfall in the range\nof 625 to 875 mm and as 0.40 for areas receiving annual rainfall in excess of 875 mm.\nTh e f actor ‘ Y’ i s taken as 1.0 f or s oi l s h avi ng poor i nfil trati on wi th l ow crop c ov er\nduring erosive rains and as 2.0 for soils of medium to good infiltration and good crop\ncover during erosive rains. When only one of these factors is favourable, the value of\nY is taken as 1.50. Vertical spacing can be increased by 10 percent or 15 cm to\nprovide better location, alignment or to avoid obstacles.\nThe horizontal interval between two bunds is calculated using the formula\nHorizontal Interval (H.I) = V.I x 100/Slope\n6.2.2.2.2 Cross Section of Contour Bunds: A trapezoidal cross section is usually\nadopted for the bund. The design of the cross section involves determination of height,\ntop width, side slopes and bottom width of the bund.\nThe height of the bund depends on the slope of the land, spacing of the bunds and the\nrainfall excess expected in 24-hour period for 10-year frequency in the area. Once the\nheight is determined, other dimensions can be worked out depending on the nature of\nthe soil.\nHeight of the bund can be determined by the following methods\na) Arbitrary Design: The depth of impounding is designed as 30 cm. 30 cm is\nprovided as depth flow over the crust of the outlet weir and 20 cm is\nprovided as free board.

Side slopes of the bund are dependent on the angle of repose of the soil in\nthe area and commonly range from 1:1 for clayey soils to 2:1 for sandy soils. Base\nwidth of the bund depends on the hydraulic gradient of the water in the bund\nmaterial due to the impounding water. A general value of hydraulic gradient\nadopted is 4:1. The base should be sufficiently wide so that the seepage line should\nnot appear above the toe on the downstream side of the bund.\nSize of the bund is expressed in terms of its cross-sectional area. The cross sectional\narea of bunds depends on the soil type and rainfall and may vary from 0.50 to 1.0 sq\nm in different regions.

The product of cross sectional area of the bund and the bunding\nintensity gives the quantity of earthwork required for bunding / hectare of land.\n6.2.2.2.3  Deviation Freedom: Strict adherence to contours while constructing bunds\nis a necessary prerequisite for ensuring maximum conservation of moisture and soil.\nHowever, to avoid excessive curvature of bunds, which makes agricultural operations\ndifficult, the following deviations are permitted\na) a maximum of 15 cm while cutting across a narrow ridge,\nb) a maximum of 30 cm while crossing a gully or depression and\nc) a maximum of 1.5 m while crossing a sharp, narrow depression not\nexceeding 5 m in width.\n6.2.2.3 Contour Trenches\nContour trenches are rainwater harvesting structures, which can be constructed on hill\nslopes as well as on degraded and barren waste lands in both high- and low- rainfall\nareas. Cross section of a typical contour trench is shown in Fig.6.6.\nFig.6.6 Schematics of a Contour Trench\nThe trenches break the slope at intervals and reduce the velocity of surface runoff.\nThe water retained in the trench will help in conserving the soil moisture and ground\nwater recharge.\nThe size of the contour trench depends on the soil depth and normally",

The size and number of trenches are worked out on\nthe basis of the rainfall proposed to be retained in the trenches. The trenches may be\ncontinuous or interrupted and should be constructed along the contours. Continuous\ntrenches are used for moisture conservation in low rainfall area whereas intermittent\ntrenches are preferred in high rainfall area.\nThe horizontal and vertical intervals between the trenches depend on rainfall, slope\nand soil depth. In steeply sloping areas, the horizontal distance between the two\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 70\ntrenches will be less compared to gently sloping areas. In areas where soil cover is\nthin, depth of trenching is restricted and more trenches at closer intervals need to be\nconstructed. In general, the horizontal interval may vary from 10 m in steep slopes to\nabout 25 m in gentle slopes.\n6.2.2.4 Gully Plugs, Nalah Bunds and Check Dams\nThese structures are constructed across gullies, nalahs or streams to check the flow of\ns u r f a c e w a t e r i n t h e s t r e a m c h a n n e l a n d t o r e t a i n w a t e r f o r l o n g e r d u r a t i o n s i n t h e\npervious soil or rock surface. As compared to gully plugs, which are normally\nconstructed across 1 st order streams, nalah bunds and check dams are constructed\nacross bigger streams and in areas having gentler slopes. These may be temporary\nstructures such as brush wood dams, loose / dry stone masonry check dams, Gabion\ncheck dams and woven wire dams constructed with locally available material or\npermanent structures constructed using stones, brick and cement.

Competent civil and\nagro-engineering techniques are to be used in the design, layout and construction of\npermanent check dams to ensure proper storage and adequate outflow of surplus water\nto avoid scours on the downstream side for long-term stability of the dam.\nThe site selected for check dam should have sufficient thickness of permeable soils or\nweathered material to facilitate recharge of stored water within a short span of time.\nThe water stored in these structures is mostly confined to the stream course and the\nheight is normally less than 2 m. These are designed based on stream width and\nexcess water is allowed to flow over the wall. In order to avoid scouring from excess\nrunoff, water cushions are provided on the downstream side. To harness maximum\nrunoff in the stream, a series of such check dams can be constructed to have recharge\no n a r e g i o n a l s c a l e . T h e d e s i g n p a r t i c u l a r s o f a c e m e n tnalah bund are shown in\nFig.6.7.\nThe following parameters should be kept in mind while selecting sites for check dams\n/ nalah bunds:\ni) The total catchment area of the stream should normally be between\n40 and 100 ha. Local situations can, however, be a guiding factor in\nthis regard.\nii) The rainfall in the catchment should be preferably less than 1000\nmm / annum.\niii) The stream bed should be 5 to 15 m wide and at least 1m deep.\niv) The soil downstream of the bund should not be prone to water\nlogging and should have a pH value between 6.5 and 8.\nv) The area downstream of the Check Dam / bund should have\nirrigable land under well irrigation.\nvi) The Check dams / Nalah bunds should preferably be located in\nareas where contour or graded bunding of lands have been carried\nout.\nvii) The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately\npermeable to cause ground water recharge.\nCheck dams / Nalah bunds are normally 10 to 15 m long, 1 to 3 m wide and",
    "een carried\nout.\nvii) The rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately\npermeable to cause ground water recharge.\nCheck dams / Nalah bunds are normally 10 to 15 m long, 1 to 3 m wide and 2 to 3 m\nhigh, generally constructed in a trapezoidal form. Detailed studies are to be made in\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 71\nthe watershed prior to construction of the check dam to assess the current erosion\ncondition, land use and water balance. The community in the watershed should also\nbe involved in the planning and selection of the type and location of the structure.\nFor construction of the check dam, a trench, about 0.6 m wide in hard rock and l.2 m\nwide in soft impervious rock is dug for the foundation of core wall. A core brick\ncement wall, 0.6 m wide and raised at least 2.5m above the nalah bed is erected and\nthe remaining portion of trench back filled on upstream side by impervious clay. The\ncore wall is buttressed on both sides by a bund made up of local clays and stone\npitching is done on the upstream face. If the bedrock is highly fractured, cement\ngrouting is done to make the foundation leakage free.\n6.2.2.5  Percolation Tanks\nPercolation tanks, which are based on principles similar to those of nalah bunds, are\namong the most common runoff harvesting structures in India.  A percolation tank can\nbe defined as an artificially created surface water body submerging a highly\npermeable land area so that the surface runoff is made to percolate and recharge the\nground water storage. They differ from nalah bunds in having larger reservoir areas.\nThey are not provided with sluices or outlets for discharging water from the tank for\nirrigation or other purposes. They may, however, be provided with arrangements for\nspilling away the surplus water that may enter the tank so as to avoid over-topping of\nthe tank bund.\nIt is possible to have more than one percolation tank in a catchment if sufficient\nsurplus ru",

In such situations, each tank of the group takes a share in the\nyield of the whole catchment above it, which can be classified as\n(i)  'free catchment', which is the catchment area that only drains into the tank\nunder  consideration and\n(ii) 'combined catchment', which is the area of the whole catchment above the\ntank.\nT h e d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n t h e c o m b i n e d a n d f r e e c a t c h m e n t g i v e s t h e a r e a o f t h e\ncatchment intercepted by the tanks located upstream of any tank. The whole\ncatchment of the highest tank on each drainage shall be its free catchment.  Moreover,\neach tank will receive the whole runoff from its free catchment, but from the\nremainder of its catchment it will receive only the balance runoff that remains after\nthe upper tanks have been filled.\n6.2.2.5.1  Site Selection Criteria: The important site selection criteria for percolation\nponds include\ni) The hydrogeology of the area should be such that the litho-units occurring\nin the area of submergence of the tank should have high permeability. The\nsoils in the catchment area of the tank should be sandy to avoid silting up\nof the tank bed.\nii) The availability of non-committed surplus monsoon runoff should be\nsufficient to ensure filling of the tank every year.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 72\niii) As the yield of catchments in low rainfall areas generally varies between\n0.44 to 0.55 M Cu m/sq km, the catchment area may be between 2.50 and\n4.0 sq km for small tanks and between 5.0 and 8.0 sq km for larger tanks.\niv) Selection of the size of a percolation tank should be governed by the\npercolation capacity of the st",

In\norder to avoid wastage of water through evaporation, larger capacity tanks\nshould be constructed only if percolation capacity is proven to be good. If\npercolation rates are low to moderate, tanks of smaller capacity may be\nconstructed. Percolation tanks are normally designed for storage capacities\nof 8 to 20 M cft. (2.26 to 5.66 M Cu m).\nv) The depth of water impounded in the tank provides the recharge head and\nhence it is necessary to design the tank to provide a minimum height of\npon ded water col um n of 3 to 4.5 m an d rarel y 6 m ab ov e th e b ed l evel .\nThis would imply construction of tanks of large capacity in areas with\nsteep gradient.\nvi) The purpose of construction of percolation tanks is to ensure recharge of\nmaximum possible surface water runoff to the aquifer in as short a period\nas possible without much evaporation losses. Normally, a percolation tank\nshould not retain water beyond February.\nvii) The percolation tank should be located downstream of runoff zone,\npreferably toward the edge of piedmont zone or in the upper part of the\ntransition zone. Land slope between 3 and 5 percent is ideal for\nconstruction of percolation tanks.\nviii) There should be adequate area suitable for irrigation and sufficient number\nof ground water abstraction structures within the command of the\npercolation tank to fully utilise the additional recharge. The area benefited\nshould have a productive phreatic aquifer with lateral continuity up to the\npercolation tank. The depth to water level in the area should remain more\nthan 3 m below ground level during post-monsoon period.\n6.2.2.5.2  Investigations Required: An area, preferably the entire watershed, needing\nadditional ground water recharge is identified on the basis of declini",

Steps should be taken to prevent severe soil erosion through appropriate soil\nconservation measures in the catchment. This will keep the tank free from siltation\nwhich otherwise reduces the percolation efficiency and life of the structure.\nDetailed geological and hydrogeological mapping is to be carried out in the area of\nsubmergence, at the tank site and also downstream of the site to find out the\npermeability of vadose zone and aquifer.

Aquifer parameters of\nwater-bearing formations in the zone of influence may also be determined to assess\nthe recharge potential and number of feasible ground water structures in the area.\nPeriodic water level measurements along with ground water sampling for water\nquality may be done before and after the construction of percolation tanks. Detailed\ngeological investigations may be carried out to study the nature and depth of\nformation at the bund (dam) site for deciding the appropriate depth of cut off trench\n(COT). This will help in reducing the visible seepage and also ensure safety and long\nlife of the structure.

    "treatment should be considered\non the basis of nature of formation while designing and constructing the dam wall and\nwaste weir.\n6.2.2.5.3  Engineering Aspects: A percolation tank is essentially an earthen structure\nwith a masonry spill way.  It should be designed with maximum capacity utilisation,\nlong life span, cost-effectiveness and optimum recharge to ground water in mind.\nStorage capacity, waste weir, drainage arrangements and cut off trench (COT) are the\nimportant features of percolation tank that need proper design.  The overall design of\nthe percolation tank is similar to that of an earthen dam constructed for minor\nirrigation.\nDetailed topographical survey to demarcate the area of submergence in natural\ndepression and alignment of dam line in the valley is to be taken up prior to\nconstruction of the structure. A number of sections along and across the drainage are\nprepared and the best suitable site is identified.  The land availability and possibility\nof land acquisition is explored during the survey. The spillway site is demarcated and\nis designed in such a way that it allows the flow of surplus water based on single day\nmaximum rainfall after the tank is filled to its maximum capacity. The depth of\nfoundation for masonry work of waste weir etc. is decided depending on the nature of\nformation. Cut Off Trench (COT) is provided to minimize the seepage losses across\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 75\nthe streambed.  The depth of COT is generally 2-6 m below ground level depending\nupon the subsurface strata. In order to avoid erosion of bund due to ripple action,\nstone pitching is provided in the upstream direction up to High Flood Level (HFL).\nThe sources for availability of constructional material, especially clay and porous soil\nfor earthwork and stone rubble for pitching are to be identified.\na) Design of Storage Capacity: Th e s torage cap aci ty of a percol ati on tan k m ay be\ndef i ned as th e",

The total capacity of the tank will be the sum of the capacities\nbetween successive contours. The smaller the contour interval, the more accurate the\ncapacity computation will be. The summation of all the volumes between successive\ncontours will be required for computing the storage capacity of the tank. When\ncontour plan is not available and only the area of the tank at FTL is known, then the\neffective volume of the tank may be roughly computed as the area multiplied by one-\nthird of the depth from FTL to the deep bed of the tank.\nThe tank is designed to ensure maximum utilisation of its capacity.  A structure of\noptimum capacity is the most cost effective. An under-utilized structure leads to\nunproductive expenditure incurred on extra earthwork.  The design of storage capacity\nof a tank depends mainly upon the proper estimation of catchment yield, which is\ncalculated as,\nQ = A * Strange's Coefficient\nWhere, Q is yield at site and A is area of the catchment.\nStrange's coefficients for various amounts of monsoon rainfall for three categories of\ncatchments, i.e. good, average and bad are available from Strange's tables provided in\nstandard Hydrology text books. The rainfall data of 40-50 years, collected from the\nnearest rain gauge station, may be used for design purposes.  The percolation tanks\nare to be designed for a realistic percentage of the yield of the catchment considering\nthe temporal distribution of monsoon rainfall. Another important consideration is the\nf a c t t h a t w a t e r s t o r e d i n a p e r c o l a t i o n t a n k s t a r t s p e r c o l a t i n g i m m e d i a t e l",

The top of dam wall is normally kept 2-\n3 m wide.  Upstream and downstream slopes of the dam wall are normally taken as\n2.5:1 and 2:1 respectively as recommended in design manual for minor irrigation\ntanks.  The design parti cular of a ty pical percol ati on tank is shown in Fig.6.8 along\nwith all relevant details.\nb) Design of Tank Bund: The tank bund, for all practical purposes, is a small-sized\nearthen dam and its design and construction should be carried out in accordance with\nthe principles applicable to earthen dams.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 76\nThe bunds of a percolation pond may be of three types, i.e.\nType A:  Homogeneous embankment type (Fig. 6.9(a))\nType B:  Zoned Embankment Type (Fig. 6. 9(b))\nType C:  Diaphragm Type (Fig. 6.9(c))\nTan k b un ds i n In di a are m os tl y of Ty pe A an d are con s truc ted wi th s oi l s ex cavated\nfrom pits in the immediate vicinity of the bund and transported to the bund.\nThe most commonly adopted standards used for fixing the dimensions of tank bunds,\nparticularly in South India are given in Table 6.5.

For inferior soils or greater\ndepths, however, the riveted slope may be made flatter, say 2:1.\nIn this way, for average cases, a 1.5:1 slope will generally be adopted for upstream\nface and 2:1 slope for downstream face.\nThis practice is contrary to the standard recommendations adopted in many countries\nwhere the upstream slope, even when riveted, is kept flatter than the downstream\nslope because of the soil being saturated. There are, however, thousands of tanks in\nTamil Nadu with slopes of 1.5:1 and failure by slipping of this slope is rare. Hence,\nthe prevailing practice can be easily adopted. In very small tanks and in cases where\nthe upstream slope is heavily riveted, upstream faces have been given 1:1 or even\nsteeper slopes in actual practice, but such steeper slopes are not recommended.\nc) Waste/ Surplus Weir: The waste/surplus weirs are constructed for discharging the\nexcess water from the tank into the downstream channel after it is filled so as to avoid\nthe rise of water in the tank above the Maximum Water Level (MWL). The water will\nstart spilling over the crest of this escape weir as and when it rises above the FTL and\nthe discharging capacity of this weir will be so designed as to pass the full flood\ndi sch arge l i kely to en ter th e tan k wi th a depth ov er th e wei r equal",

Upstream Revetment of Tank Bunds\nAlthough the effective storage capacity of a percolation tank is limited by FTL, the\narea submerged by the tank bund and revetment is dependent on MWL. Hence, in\norder to restrict the dimensions of these, it is desirable to keep the difference between\nFTL and MWL as small as possible. On the other hand, the smaller the difference, the\nlonger will be the surplus escape required in order to enable it to pass the given\ndischarge. Hence, the difference (H) between FTL and MWL is fixed on a\ncompromise basis in each particular project so as to obtain maximum economy and\nefficiency. In small and medium sized tanks, the usual difference between FTL and\nMWL is kept between 0.30 and 0.60 m and is rarely allowed to exceed 0.90 m.\nS u r p l u s w e i r s a r e s i m i l a r t o r i v e r w e i r s ( i . e .

The shutters can be dropped down during floods\nso as to reduce the afflux (the rise in the Maximum Flood Level (HFL) upstream\nof the weir caused due to the construction of the weir) by increasing the\nwaterway opening. This type of weir is particularly suitable for hard clay and\nconsolidated gravel foundations.

For this, the channel is so modified that the flow gets spread over a wider area,\nresulting in increased contact with the streambed. The methods commonly used\ninclude a) widening, leveling, scarifying or construction of ditches in the stream\nchannel, b) construction of L – shaped finger levees or hook levees in the river bed at\nthe end of high stream flow season and c) Low head check dams which allow flood\nwaters to pass over them safely.\nStream channel modification can be employed in areas having influent streams that\nare mostly located in piedmont regions and areas with deep water table such as arid\nand semi arid regions and in valley fill deposits. The structures constructed for stream\nchannel modification are generally temporary, are designed to augment ground water\nrecharge seasonally and are likely to be destroyed by floods. These methods are\ncommonly applied in alluvial areas, but can also be gainfully used in hard rock areas\nwhere thin river alluvium overlies good phreatic aquifers or the rocks are extensively\nweathered or fractured in and around the stream channel. Artificial recharge through\nstream channel modifications could be made more effective if surface storage dams\nexist upstream of the recharge sites as they facilitate controlled release of water.\n6.2.3.

    "e Techniques\nSubsurface techniques aim at recharging deeper aquifers that are overlain by\nimpermeable layers, preventing the infiltration from surface sources to recharge them\nunder natural conditions. The most common methods used for recharging such deeper\naquifers are a) Injection wells or recharge wells, b) Recharge pits and shafts, c) Dug\nwell recharge, d) Borehole flooding and e) Recharge through natural openings and\ncavities.\n6.2.3.1 Injection Wells or Recharge Wells\nI n j e c t i o n w e l l s o r r e c h a r g e w e l l s a r e s t r u c t u r e s s i m i l a r t o b o r e / t u b e w e l l s b u t\nconstructed for augmenting the ground water storage in deeper aquifers through\nsupply of water either under gravity or under pressure. The aquifer to be replenished\nis generally one with considerable desaturation due to overexploitation of ground\nwater. Artificial recharge of aquifers by injection wells can also be done in coastal\nregions to arrest the ingress of seawater and to combat problems of land subsidence in\nareas where confined aquifers are heavily pumped.\nIn alluvial areas, injection wells recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can\nbe constructed in a manner similar to normal gravel packed pumping wells. However,\nin case of recharge wells, cement sealing of the upper section of the wells is done to\nprevent the injection pressure from causing leakage of water through the annular\nspace of the borehole and the well assembly. Schematics of a typical injection well in\nalluvial terrain are shown in Fig.6.12.  I n h a r d r o c k a r e a s , i n j e c t i o n w e l l s m a y n o t\nrequire casing pipes and screens and an injection pipe with an opening against the\nfractures to be recharged may be sufficient.

Attempts to augment recharge may prove to be\ncounter-productive in cases where the aquifer material gets eroded due to the speed of\nground water flow, especially in unconsolidated or semi-consolidated aquifers.\nFailure of confining layers may also occur if excessive pressure is applied while\ninjecting water. These may result in clogging and/or even collapse of the bore/tube\nwell.\n6.2.3.1.1 Site Selection and Design Criteria\ni) A proper understanding of the aquifer geometry is the most important\nfactor in implementation of successful recharge schemes through\ninjection or recharge wells. Detailed studies of the vertical and lateral\nextents of the aquifer and its characteristics are necessary prerequisites\nfor such schemes. Grain size distribution of granular aquifers is\nanother important parameter in the case of sedimentary aquifers.\nii) Recharge through injection wells increases chances of clogging of well\nscreens and aquifer material, resulting in decreased injection rates.\nClogging may be caused by suspended particles and air bubbles in the\nsource water, formation of chemical precipitates in the well, source\nwater or aquifer material, proliferation of bacteria in and around the\ninjection well and swelling and dispersion of clay in the aquifer being\nrecharged. Clogging may be minimized by proper treatment and\nremoval of suspended material from source water, chemical\nstabilization and bacterial control. Using non-corrosive materials for\npipelines and well casings may minimize clogging by corrosion\nproducts. Chlorination of source water prevents development of\nbacterial growth.

Acid treatment helps in removing calcium carbonate\nprecipitates from the gravel packs and aquifers. Periodic development\nof wells through surging, swabbing and pumping can considerably\nimprove the efficiency and life of injection wells.\niii) As clogging increases the well losses considerably, the efficiency of\ninjection wells should be taken as 40 to 60 percent as compared to\npumping wells of similar design in the same situation.\niv) Adequate care should be taken to ensure that the water being used for\nrecharge is not contaminated. The water being recharged should be\ncompatible with the formation water to avoid any precipitation and\nresultant clogging. The relative temperatures of source and formation\nwaters also affect the recharge rate.\nv) For optimum benefits, it is advisable to have injection – cum –\npumping wells to be used both for ground water recharge and\nextraction under favourable conditions.\nvi) The following considerations are important in the design of an\ninjection well\na) The permissible pressure head of hydraulic injection in terms of\nwater column may be worked out as 1.2 times the depth to the top\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 87\nof the confined aquifer, which represent the hydrofracturing\npressure of the confining layer.

The recharge water should be guided through a pipe to the\nbottom of well, below the water level to avoid scouring of bottom and\nentrapment of air bubbles in the aquifer.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 91\nFig.6.13 Schematics of a Typical System for Artificial Recharge through Dug\nWell.\n6.2.3.3 Recharge Pits and Shafts\nRecharge pits and shafts are artificial recharge structures commonly used for\nrecharging shallow phreatic aquifers, which are not in hydraulic connection with\nsurface water due to the presence of impermeable layers. They do not necessarily\npenetrate or reach the unconfined aquifers like gravity head recharge wells and the\nrecharging water has to infiltrate through the vadose zone.\n6.2.3.3.1 Recharge Pits: Recharge pits are normally excavated pits, which are\nsufficiently deep to penetrate the low-permeability layers overlying the unconfined\naquifers ( Fig.6.14). They are similar to recharge basins in principle, with the only\ndifference being that they are deeper and have restricted bottom area.

Ideal sites for\nsuch trenches are influent stretches of streams. Contour trenches, which have been\ndescribed earlier also belongs to this category.\n6.2.3.3.1.1 Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines\ni) The recharging capacity of the pit increase with its area of cross section.\nHence, it is always advisable to construct as large a pit as possible.\nii) The permeability of the underlying strata should be ascertained through\ninfiltration tests before taking up construction of recharge pits.\niii) The side slopes of recharge pits should be 2:1 as steep slopes reduce\nclogging and sedimentation on the walls of the pit.\niv) Recharge pits may be used as ponds for storage and infiltration of water or\nthey may be back-filled with gravel sand filter material over a layer of\ncobbles/boulders at the bottom. Even when the pits are to be used as ponds,\nit is desirable to provide a thin layer of sand at the bottom to prevent the silt\nfrom clogging permeable strata.\nv) As i n th e cas e of water s preadi ng techni ques , th e s ource water b ei n g us ed\nfor recharge should be as silt-free as possible.\nvi) The bottom area of the open pits and the top sand layer of filter-packed pits\nmay require periodic cleaning to ensure proper recharge. Recharge pits\nlocated in flood-prone areas and on streambeds are likely to be effective for\nshort duration only due to heavy silting.

Further, they are much smaller\nin cross section when compared to recharge pits. Detailed design particulars of a\nrecharge shaft are shown in Fig.6.16\n6.2.3.3.2.1 Design Guidelines\ni) Recharge shafts may be dug manually in non-caving strata. For construction\nof deeper shafts, drilling by direct rotary or reverse circulation may be\nrequired.\nii) The shafts may be about 2m in diameter at the bottom if manually dug. In\ncase of drilled shafts, the diameter may not exceed 1m.\niii) The shaft should reach the permeable strata by penetrating the overlying low\npermeable layer, but need not necessarily touch the water table.\niv) Unlined shafts may be back-filled with an inverse filter, comprising\nboulders/cobbles at the bottom, followed by gravel and sand. The upper\nsand layer may be replaced periodically. Shafts getting clogged due to biotic\ngrowth are difficult to be revitalized and may have to be abandoned.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 93\nFig.6.15 Schematics of Recharge Shafts\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 94\nFig.6.16 Design Particulars of a Typical Recharge Shaft\nv) Deeper shafts constructed in caving strata may require lining or casing.

The most common methods in this category are induced recharge from surface\nwater sources and aquifer modification techniques.\n6.3.1 Induced Recharge\nInduced recharge involves pumping water from an aquifer, which is hydraulically\nconnected with surface water to induce recharge to the ground water reservoir. Once\nhydraulic connection gets established by the interception of the cone of depression\nand the river recharge boundary, the surface water sources starts providing part of the\npumping yield ( Fig.6.17). Induced recharge, under favorable hydrogeological\nconditions, can be used for improving the quality of surface water resources due to its\npassage through the aquifer material. Collector wells and infiltration galleries, used\nfor obtaining very large water supplies from riverbeds, lakebeds and waterlogged\nareas also function on the principle of induced recharge.\nFig.6.17 Principle of Induced Recharge through Pumping of Wells near a Stream\na) Natural Flow Pattern b) Change in Flow Pattern Due to Pumping.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 95\nIn hard rock areas, abandoned buried channels often provide favorable sites for the\nconstruction of structures for induced recharge.

    "channels often provide favorable sites for the\nconstruction of structures for induced recharge. Check dams constructed in the river\nchannel upstream of the channel bifurcation can help in high infiltration to the\nchannel when wells located in the channels are pumped with high discharge for\nprolonged periods.\n6.3.1.1 Design Guidelines\ni) Quality of source water, hydraulic characteristics and thickness of aquifer\nm a t e r i a l , d i s t a n c e o f t h e p u m p i n g w e l l s f r om t h e r i v e r a n d t h e i r p u m p i n g\nrates are the important factors controlling the design of schemes for induced\nrecharge.\nii) For implementation of successful induced recharge schemes from stream\nchannels, pumping wells should be selected at sites where water in the\nstreams has sufficient velocity to prevent silt deposition.\niii) Dredging of channel bottom in the vicinity of the existing pumping wells\nmay have to be carried our periodically to remove organic matter and\nimpervious fine material from the beds of the channel.\niv) For wells constructed in unconfined alluvial strata for induced recharge, the\nlower one-third of the wells may be screened to have optimum drawdowns.\nIn highly fractured consolidated rocks, dug wells penetrating the entire\nthickness of the aquifer should be constructed with lining above the water\ntable zone and the curbing height well above the High Flow Level (HFL) of\nthe stream.\n6.3.2 Aquifer Modification Techniques\nThese techniques modify the aquifer characteristics to increase its capacity to store\nand transmit water through artificial means. The most important techniques under this\ncategory are bore blasting techniques and hydrofracturing techniques. Though they\nare yield augmentation techniques rather than artificial recharge structures, they are\nalso being considered as artificial recharge structures owing to the resultant increase\nin the storage of ground water in the aquifers.\n6.4 Combination Methods\nVarious combinations of surface and sub-su",

The selection of methods to be combined in such cases is\nsite-specific. Commonly adopted combination methods include a) recharge basins\nwith shafts, percolation ponds with recharge pits or shafts and induced recharge with\nwells tapping multiple aquifers permitting water to flow from upper to lower aquifer\nzones through the annular space between the walls and casing (connector wells) etc.\n6.5 Ground Water Conservation Techniques\nGround water conservation techniques are intended to retain the ground water for\nlonger periods in the basin/watershed by arresting the sub-surface flow. The known\ntechniques of ground water conservation are a) Ground water dams / sub-surface\ndykes / Underground ‘Bandharas’ and b) Fracture sealing Cementation techniques.\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 96\n6.5.1 Sub-Surface Dykes / Ground Water Dams / Underground ‘Bandharas’\nA sub-surface dyke / ground water dam is a sub-surface barrier constructed across a\nstream channel for arresting/retarding the ground water flow and increase the ground\nwater storage. At favorable locations, such dams can also be constructed not only\nacross streams, but in large areas of the valley as well for conserving ground water.\nSchematics of a typical sub-surface dyke are shown in Fig.6.18\n6.5.1.1 Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines\ni) T h e p r i m a r y o b j e c ti v e o f a s u b - s u r f a c e d y k e i s t h e c r e a ti o n o f a s u b s u r f a c e\nstorage reservoir with suitable recharge conditions and low seepage losses.\nValley shapes and gradients are important considerations for site\nidentification.\nii) O",

This reduces the cost of the structure and makes it possible to\nhave a comparatively large storage volume. This implies that the gradient of\nthe valley floor should not be steep since that would reduce the storage\nvolumes behind a dam of given height.\niii) The limitations on depth of underground construction deem that the\nunconfined aquifer should be within a shallow to moderate depth (down to 10\nm bgl) and has a well-defined impermeable base layer.  Such situations occur\nin hard rock areas and shallow alluvial riverine deposits.\nFig.6.18 Schematics of a Subsurface Dyke in Basaltic Terrain.\n\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 97\niv) The dyke is ideally constructed across narrow ground water valleys, generally\nn ot ex ceedi n g 150 to 200 m i n wi dth . On th e basi s of a th or ough s tudy of a\nwater table contour map of the area, a narrow ground water valley section\nwhere the flow lines tend to converge from up-gradient direction, usually\ncoinciding with a surface drainage line should be identified. The requirement\nof narrow flow section is usually fulfilled in watersheds in hard rock terrain\nhaving rolling topography where relatively narrow depressions separate hard\nrock spurs.\nv) The drainage valley across which the subsurface dyke is constructed should\ncarry a seasonal stream that goes dry in winter and summer and the water table\nshould be located well below the riverbed, preferably throughout the year (The\nstream should be preferably influent or may be effluent for a very limited\nperiod during rainy season). The valley section should preferably have a\nmoderate gradient (less than 1%) so that the benefit spreads sufficie",
    "preferably influent or may be effluent for a very limited\nperiod during rainy season). The valley section should preferably have a\nmoderate gradient (less than 1%) so that the benefit spreads sufficiently in the\nup-gradient direction.\nvi) The thickness of aquifer underlying the site should be adequate (more than 5\nm) so that the quantity of ground water stored is commensurate with the effort\nand investment. Normally, in hard rock watersheds, the drainage courses have\na limited thickness of alluvial deposits underlain by a weathered rock or\nfractured aquifer, which in turn passes into consolidated unaltered aquitard.\nThis forms an ideal situation.\nvii) The sub-surface dyke directly benefits the up-gradient area and hence should\nbe located at a sufficient distance below the storage zone and areas benefiting\nfrom such recharge. This implies construction of ground water conservation\nstructures in lower parts of the catchments but sufficiently upstream of\nwatershed outlet.\nviii) A sub-surface dyke may potentially deprive the downstream users the benefit\nof ground water seepage, which they received under a natural flow regime.\nCare should therefore be taken to see that a large number of users are not\nlocated immediately downstream and those affected are duly compensated\nthrough sharing of benefits. Care should also be taken to ensure that the water\nlevels in the upstream side of the dyke are deep enough not to cause any water\nlogging as a result of the dyke.\nix) For construction of ground water dam/ sub-surface dykes, a trench should be\ndug out across the ground water depression (streambed) from one bank to the\nother. In case of hilly terrain in hard rocks, the length of the trench generally\nmay be less than 50 m.  In more open terrain, the length may be usually less\nthan 200 m but occasionally even more. It should be wide enough at the\nbottom to provide space for construction activity. In   case of shallow trenches\ndown to 5 m depth, the width at the bottom should be 2 m",

In\ncase of hard rock terrain, below a limited thickness of alluvial fill, weathered\nzone and underlying fractured aquifer may occur.

In case of\nmore open terrain in consolidated or semi-consolidated strata, the alluvial\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 98\nthickness may be larger and the trench should end below the alluvial fill\ndeposit. In order to minimize or avoid problem of dewatering during\nconstruction, the work should be taken up by the end of winter and completed\nwell before the onset of rains, as water table is at lower elevation in this\nperiod.\nxi) The cut-out dyke could be either of stone or brick masonry or an impermeable\nclay barrier.

In case good impermeable clay is not available, a stone masonry\nwall of 0.45 metre thickness or a brick wall of 0.25 m thickness may be\nconstructed on a bed of concrete.  Cement mortar of 1: 5 proportion and\ncement pointing on both faces is considered adequate. In the case of very long\ntrenches, for economic considerations, it may be necessary to provide masonry\nwall only in the central part of dyke and clay dyke suitably augmented by tar\nfelting, PVC sheet etc. on the sides.\nxii) In case of clay dykes, the width should be between 1.5 and 2m depending on\nthe quality of clay used. The construction should be in layers and each fresh\nlayer should be watered and compacted by plain sheet or sheep foot rollers of\n1 to 2 ton capacity. In absence of roller, the clay should be manually\ncompacted by hand ramets. Where the core wall is a masonry structure, the\nremaining open trench should be back-filled by impermeable clay. The\nunderground structures should be keyed into both the flanks of stream for one\nmeter length to prevent leakage from sides.\nxiii) The top of the underground structures should be located between 1 to 1.5 m\nbelow the streambed to permit overflow in high water table stage for flushing\nof salinity of ground water stored behind the dyke. The alignment of the dyke\nshould be shown by fixing marker stones on the banks and whenever there is\nchange of alignment in between. Before back-filling the sub-surface trench,\npiezometric tubes should be installed on both the faces of the dyke for\nmeasuring water levels. Such piezometers should be located in the central part,\nand in case of wider dykes at additional one or two locations.\nxiv) Sites for construction of subsurface dykes have to be located in areas where\nthere is a great scarcity of water during the summer months or where there is\nneed for additional water for irrigation.

Single ownership is ideal in the absence of which it has to be\nimplemented on a cooperative basis.\n6.6. Suitability of Artificial Recharge Structures under Combinations of Factors\nBased on the discussions regarding various artificial recharge methods and structures,\nan attempt has been made to prescribe structures suitable for different slope\ncategories, aquifer types and amount of precipitation received.\nA matrix (Table 6.7) has been developed for easy visualization of these combinations\nand their possible variations. Three broad columns represent three distinct\nhydrogeologic settings normally encountered in nature.  Each of these columns is split\nArtificial Recharge Techniques and Designs\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 99\nfurther to represent areas based on the adequacy of rainfall received.  Areas receiving\nannual precipitation of less than 1000 mm and not having access to any surface inflow\nsource are taken as areas with limited source water availability.\nFour different slope categories have been considered in the matrix, representing\nrunoff zone, piedmont zone, transition zone and storage zone.  Indirectly, this\nclassification also takes into account the status of ground water flow in the aquifer.\nWithin each row the upper box represents the unconfined aquifers and the lower one\nrepresents for the leaky confined and confined aquifers.\nThe matrix thus tries to separate out 48 different combinations, all of which may not\nbe relevant or suitable for effecting artificial recharge.

    "Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 102\n7. ROOF TOP RAINWATER HARVESTING\nDrinking water supply in urban areas is mostly from surface sources like natural or\nimpounded reservoirs and from ground water sources. As the population density and\nusage levels are comparatively high in urban areas, Government agencies construct,\noperate and maintain huge surface water dams and reservoirs for meeting their water\ndemands. These sources are planned and constructed to take care of the water\nrequirements of the population throughout the year. Ground water is in use in areas\nwhere the surface water supplies are either not reaching or are not adequate.\nIn most of the rural areas, ground water is the major source of drinking water. In\nearlier days, open wells and ponds that belonged to the community were the source of\ndrinking water supply. With the advent of bore well technology and progress made in\nrural electrification, the scenario of rural water supply has considerably changed. The\ntraditional methods and practices have given way to hand pumps and power pump\nschemes. Government organisations have given priority to provide protected water\nsupply to the villages through rural water supply schemes. Bore wells are drilled and\nwater from over-head tanks is distributed through supply mains.  Statistics reveal that\nmore than 85% of rural water supply is from the ground water sources at present.\nIndiscriminate exploitation of ground water and the decline in ground water levels\nhave rendered many bore wells dry either seasonally or through out the year. To\novercome such a situation, bore wells and tube wells are now being drilled to greater\ndepths, often tapping ground water from deep aquifers hitherto considered ‘static’.\nDischarge of untreated effluents into surface water streams and lakes by industries has\nresulted not only in contaminating the surface water resources, but also the ground\nwater bodies.

    "ms and lakes by industries has\nresulted not only in contaminating the surface water resources, but also the ground\nwater bodies.  In coastal areas, over exploitation of ground water has resulted in\nseawater intrusion, rendering ground water sources saline in some areas.\nIdentification and promotion of simple, reliable and environmental friendly\ntechnologies for augmentation of ground water resources are necessary to overcome\nthe above problems and to ensure the long-term sustainability of our precious ground\nwater resources.  Reviving the traditional practices of rainwater harvesting along\nscientific lines can go a long way in preventing a serious water crisis in the major part\nof our country in the years to come.\n7.1 Concept of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nThe concept of rainwater harvesting involves ‘tapping the rainwater where it falls’. A\nmaj or porti on of rainwater that f alls on the earth’s surface runs off into stream s and\nrivers and finally into the sea. An average of 8-12 percent of the total rainfall recharge\nonly is considered to recharge the aquifers. The technique of rainwater harvesting\ninvolves collecting the rain from localized catchment surfaces such as roofs, plain /\nsloping surfaces etc., either for direct use or to augment the ground water resources\ndepending on local conditions.  Construction of small barriers across small streams to\ncheck and store the running water also can be considered as water harvesting.\nAmong various techniques of water harvesting, harvesting water from roof tops needs\nspecial attention because of the following advantages:\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 103\na) Roof top rainwater harvesting is one of the appropriate options for augmenting\nground water recharge/ storage in urban areas where natural recharge is\nconsiderably reduced due to increased urban activities and not much land is\navailable for implementing any other artificial recharge measure.

Roof top\nrainwater harvesting can supplement the domestic requirements in rural areas as\nwell.\nb) Rainwater runoff which otherwise flows through sewers and storm drains and is\nwasted, can be harvested and utilized.\nc) Rainwater is bacteriologically safe, free from organic matter and is soft in nature.\nd) It helps in reducing the frequent drainage congestion and flooding during heavy\nrains in urban areas where availability of open surfaces is limited and surface\nrunoff is quite high.\ne) It improves the quality of ground water through dilution.\nf) The harnessed rainwater can be utilized at the time of need.\ng) The structures required for harvesting rainwater are simple, economical and eco-\nfriendly.\nh) Roof catchments are relatively cleaner and free from contamination compared to\nthe ground level catchments.\ni) Losses from roof catchments are much less when compared to other catchments.\nCollection of rainwater from roof tops for domestic needs is popular in some parts of\nI n d i a .

The water thus\ncollected can meet the immediate domestic needs. Tanks made of iron sheets, cement\nor bricks can also be used for storing water. In this method, water is collected from\nroofs using drain pipes/gutters fixed to roof edge.\nT h o u g h t h e p r a c ti c e o f r o o f t o p r a i n w a t e r h a r v e s t i n g i s a n a g e - ol d o n e , s y s t e m a ti c\ncollection and storage of water to meet the drinking water needs has become popular\nonly recently.

The popularity of this practice is limited by the costs involved in\ncollection of water by gutters/pipes and its storage in underground tanks made of iron\nor brick.  Use of Ferro-cement technology in construction and maintenance of storage\ntanks has become popular in recent years as the strength and durability of ferro-\ncement structures have been found to make the schemes cost-effective.\nRainwater harvesting practices vary widely in size, type of construction material used\nand methods of collection and storage.  Easy availability of know-how on systematic\nand economic methods of construction will encourage the user households to adopt\nthis practice.  There is also a need for creating awareness and for development of\nsimple techniques of construction/fabrication of the components of rainwater\nharvesting system for popularising this technique as a potential alternative source of\ndrinking water, at least for part of the year.\n7.2 Components of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting System\nIn a typical domestic roof top rainwater harvesting system, rainwater from the roof is\ncollected in a storage vessel or tank for use during periods of scarcity. Such systems\nare usually designed to support the drinking and cooking needs of the family and\ncomprise a roof, a storage tank and guttering to transport the water from the roof to\nt h e s t o r a g e t a n k .

Therefore, a typical Roof top Rainwater Harvesting System ( Fig.7.1)\ncomprises following components:\n Roof catchment.\n Drain pipes\n Gutters\n Down pipe\n First flush pipe.\n Filter unit\n Storage tank.\n Collection sump.\n Pump unit\nFig.",

B ri ef d es c ri p ti on s of e a ch of th e c om p on en ts a r e\ngiven below:\n7.2.1 Roof Catchment\nThe roof of the house is used as the catchment for collecting the rainwater.  The style,\nconstruction and material of the roof determine its suitability as a catchment.  Roofs\nmade of corrugated iron sheet, asbestos sheet, tiles or concrete can be utilized as such\nfor harvesting rainwater.  Thatched roofs, on the other hand, are not suitable as pieces\nof roof material may be carried by water and may also impart some colour to water.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 105\n7.2.2 Drain Pipes\nT h e d r a i n p i p e s o f s u i t a b l e s i z e , m a d e o f P V C / S t o n e w a r e a r e p r o v i d e d i n R C C\nbuildings to drain off the roof top water to the storm drains. They are provided as per\nthe building code requirements.\n7.2.3 Gutters\nGutters are channels fixed to the edges of roof all around to collect and transport the\nrainwater from the roof to the storage tank.  Gutters can be prepared in rectangular\nshapes (Fig.7.2) and semi-circular (Fig.7.3).\nFig. 7.2 Rectangular Gutter        Fig. 7.3 Semi-circular Gutter\nGutters are channels made of either plain Galvanized Iron sheets or cut PVC pipes or\nsplit Bamboo.  These channels are fixed to the roof ends to divert the rainwater into\nthe storage tank.  Semi-circular or rectangu",
    "nnels made of either plain Galvanized Iron sheets or cut PVC pipes or\nsplit Bamboo.  These channels are fixed to the roof ends to divert the rainwater into\nthe storage tank.  Semi-circular or rectangular shaped channels can be made using GI\nsheet.  Cut PVC pipes and Bamboos will be semi-circular in shape.  These channels\nare made at the site of construction and fixed to the roof by using mild steel supports.\nAs the preparation of gutters from GI sheet involves cutting and bending the sheet to\nth e r e q u i r e d s i z e an d s h a p e , c e r ta i n am oun t of s ki l l i s r e q ui re d .  G u t te r s f r om P V C\npipes or bamboos are easily made. Use of locally available materials reduces the\noverall cost of the system.\n7.2.4 Down Pipe\nDown pipe is the pipe that carries the rainwater from the gutters to the storage tank.\nDown pipe is joined with the gutters at one end, whereas the other end is connected to\nthe fil ter uni t of the storage tank as shown bel ow ( Fig.7.4).  PVC or GI pi pes of 50\nmm to 75 mm (2 inch to 3 inch) diameter are commonly used for down pipe. In the\ncase of RCC buildings, drain pipes themselves serve as down pipes. They have to be\nconnected to a pipe to carry water to the storage tank.\nThe down pipe and first flush pipe can be of either GI or PVC material of diameter\n7.5 cm.  Joining of pipes will be easy if both are of same material.\n\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 106\nFig. 7.4 Down Pipe\nT h e or i en ta ti on an d a r r a n gem en t of th e d ow n pi p e d e p en d s on r el a ti v e l oc a ti on s of\ntank and roof.

W h en th e f i rs t\nrains arrive, these unwanted materials will be washed into the storage tank.  This\ncauses contamination of water collected in the storage tank, rendering it unfit for\ndrinking and cooking purposes.\nA first flush system can be incorporated in the roof top rainwater harvesting systems\nto dispose off the ‘first flush’ water so that is does not enter the tank.  There are two\nsuch simple systems.  One is based on a simple, manually operated arrangement,\nwhereby the down pipe is moved away from the tank inlet and replaced again once\nthe first flush water has been disposed. In another semi-automatic system, a separate\nvertical pipe is fixed to the down pipe with a valve provided below the ‘T’ junction\n(Fig.7.6).\n\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 107\nFig.7.6 First Flush Pipe\nAfter the first rain is washed out through first flush pipe, the valve is closed to allow\nthe water to enter the down pipe and reach the storage tank.\n7.2.6 Filtration of Water\n7.2.6.1 Process of Filtration\nF i l tr a ti on f orm s th e m os t i m p or ta n t p r oc e s s i n th e p u ri f i c a ti on of wa te r .  I t u s u al ly\ninvolves allowing water to pass through a filter media e.g. sand.  Filtration essentially\ninvolves removal of suspended and colloidal impurities present in water. Depending\non the type of filtration, the chemical characteristics of water may be altered and the\nbacterial content may be considerably reduced. These effects take place due to various\nprocesses such as mechanical straining, sedimentation, biological metabolism and\nelectrolytic changes.\nMechanical straining involves removal of suspended particles, which are unable to\npass through the voids of the filter media. Sedimentation of particles of impurities\noccurs in the voids between sand grains in the filter unit. S",
    "s removal of suspended particles, which are unable to\npass through the voids of the filter media. Sedimentation of particles of impurities\noccurs in the voids between sand grains in the filter unit. Such particles also adhere to\nthe sand grains due to i) presence of a gelatinous film or coating developed on sand\ngrains by previously trapped bacteria and colloidal matter and ii) physical attraction\nbetween particles. Biological metabolism in filter units involves the formation of a\nzoological jelly or film containing large colonies of bacteria around the sand grains,\nwhich feed on the organic impurities in the water and convert them into harmless\ncompounds by complex biochemical reactions. Electrolytic changes involve the\nneutralization of ionic charges of particles of suspended and dissolved impurities\nwhen they come into contact with sand particles having opposite charge. When this\nh a p p e n s , t h e y n e u t r a l i z e e a c h o t h e r , w h i c h u l t i m a t e l y r e s u l t s i n t h e a l t e r a t i o n o f\nchemical characteristics of water.\n7.2.6.2 Filter Sand\nThe sand being used for filter in roof top rainwater harvesting systems should be free\nfrom clay, loam, vegetable matter, organic impurities etc. and should also be uniform\nin nature and grain size. In place of sand, ‘anthrafilt’, made from anthracite (stone-\ncoal) can also be used as filter medium. This material is found to possess many\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 108\nadvantages such as low cost, high rate of infiltration and better efficiency. However,\nas sand is readily available almost everywhere, the usual practice is to use it as filter\nmedium.\n7.2.6.3 Classification of Filters\nFilters are classified into two main categories viz. Slow sand filters and Rapid sand\nfilters based on the rate of filtration. They have also been categorised as gravity filters\nand pressure filters depending on the forces aiding the process of filtration. Based on\nth",
    "rs and Rapid sand\nfilters based on the rate of filtration. They have also been categorised as gravity filters\nand pressure filters depending on the forces aiding the process of filtration. Based on\nthese, filters can be classified into i) Slow Sand Filters, ii) Rapid Sand Filters (gravity\ntype) and iii) Pressure Filters.\ni) Slow Sand Filters\nA t y p i c a l s l o w s a n d f i l t e r (Fig.7.7 & 7.8 ) c o n s i s t s o f a n e n c l o s u r e t a n k , u n d e r -\ndrainage system, base material, filter media (sand) and appurtenances.\nFig.7.7 Plan of a Slow Sand Filter\nOne of the major disadvantages of a slow sand filter is the requirement of\nconsiderable space for its installation. This makes it uneconomical for places where\nland is not available, or it is costly. This has led engineers and scientists to find out\nmeans for increasing the rate of filtration. It is observed that rate of filtration can be\nincreased either by increasing the grain size of sand used as filter media so that\nfrictional resistance to water passing through it is reduced, or by allowing water to\npass under pressure through the filter media.\nii. Rapid Sand Filters (Gravity type)\nRapid sand filters have been developed to achieve increased filtration rates by\nincreasing the grain size of the filter media. These types of filters are preferred for\nrainwater harvesting schemes implemented over larger areas\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 109\nFig.7.8 Cross section of a Slow Sand Filter\nEssential Parts\nThe layout of a typical rapid sand filter (gravity type) is shown in Fig. 7.9.\nFig. 7.9 Lay out of a Typical Rapid Sand Filter\nThe essential parts are the same as those of the slow sand filter, viz. Enclosure tank,\nUnder-drainage system, Base material, Filter media (sand) and appurtenances.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 110\nEnclosure Tank: A watertight tank, either of masonry or concrete is used.

The sides\nand floor are coated with waterproof material. Depth of the tank is about 2.50 to 3.0\nm. The surface area of a unit of rapid sand filter varies from 10 to 50 m2. The units are\narranged in series.\nUnder-Drainage System: There are various types of under-drainage systems, most of\nwhich are patented by the manufacturers. Two of the common types of under-\ndrainage systems are Perforated Pipe Systems and Pipe and Strainer Systems.\nIn a Perforated Pipe System, a number of lateral drains are attached to a central drain\nor manifold ( Fig. 7.10). The drains are usually made of cast iron. The lateral drains\na r e p l a c e d a t d i s t a n c e s o f 1 5 t o 3 0 c m . T h e y a r e a l s o p r o v i d e d w i t h h o l e s a t t h e\nbottom in such a way that the holes are at 30° with the vertical ( Fig. 7.11). The holes\nare about 10 mm in diameter and are sometimes staggered on either side instead of\nbeing continuous. The holes are usually drilled with a centre to centre distance of 75\nto 200 mm. Brass bushings are sometimes inserted in the holes to prevent rusting of\nsurface of holes. Concrete blocks, 40 to 50 mm thick, are placed on the floor of the\nfilter for supporting lateral drains.\nPerforated Pipe Systems are economical and simple in operation. They, however,\nrequire large quantities of about 700 litres of wash water per square metre of filter\narea for washing purpose. The wash water for this ‘high velocity wash’ is provided\nfrom a wash water overhead tank as shown in Fig. 7.9.\nPi p e an d S tr a i n e r Sy s tem s al s o h av e a cen tr a l d rai n or m an i f ol d wi th l a te r al d r ai ns\nattached on either side ( Fig.7.12).

A strainer (Fig.7.13) is a small pipe\nof brass, closed at the top and having perforations on its surface. They are either\ns c r e w e d or f i x e d on th e l a te r al d r ai n s . I n s om e ca s e s , th e s tr a i n e r s a r e f i x e d on th e\ncentral drain as well. Two lateral drains / strainers are normally placed at a distance of\n15 cm from each other.  It is desirable to place all the strainers at the same elevation.\nFig.7.10 Plan of Under-drainage System in a Rapid Sand Filter\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 111\nFig.7.11 Plan of a Perforated Lateral Drain\nIn Pipe and Strainer Systems, compressed air is used for cleaning the filter, which\nresults in saving of wash water. It still requires about 250 litres of wash water per\nminute per square metre of filter area for washing purpose. This process of washing is\nknown as ‘low velocity wash’.\nFig.7.12 Cross Section of Pipe and Strainer System\nFig. 7.13 Cross Section of a Strainer\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 112\nUnder-Drainage System: The under-drainage system in Pipe and Strainer Systems\nare designed in such a way that the ratio of length of lateral drain to its diameter does\nnot exceed 20 and the cross-sectional area of the central drain is about twice the cross-\nsectional area of the lateral drains. Care should be taken to ensure that the total cross-\nsectional area of the perforations is about 0.20 percent of the total filter area and the\ncross-sectional area of a lateral is about two to four times the total cross-sectional area\nof the perforations in it.\nBase Material: Gravel is used as the base material, which is placed on the top of the\nunder-drainage system. The gravel being used should be clean and free from clay,\ndust, silt and organic matter and should be durable, hard,",
    "sed as the base material, which is placed on the top of the\nunder-drainage system. The gravel being used should be clean and free from clay,\ndust, silt and organic matter and should be durable, hard, round and strong. The\nthickness of the layer of base material varies from 45 to 60 cm. It is usually graded\nand laid in layers of 15 cm. The size of the gravel increases from top to bottom.\nFilter Media (Sand): A layer of coarse sand, ranging in thickness from 60 to 90 cm\nis placed above the gravel. The effective size of sand used varies from 0.35 to 0.60\nmm and its uniformity coefficient is between 1.20 and 1.70, ensuring increased rate of\nfiltration on account of the increase in the void space between particles when\ncompared to slow sand filters.\nAppurtenances: In addition to the usual appurtenances required in the case of slow\nsand filters, the following special devices are to be provided in case of rapid sand\nfilters:\ni) Air Compressors: The agitation of sand grains during washing of filters is\nachieved by compressed air, water jet or mechanical rakes. When compressed\nair is to be used, an air compressor of suitable capacity should be installed.\nGenerally, it should have the capacity of supplying compressed air at the rate\nof 0.60 to 0.80 m3 per minute per square metre of filter area for 5 minutes. The\npressure of compressed air should be sufficient to overcome frictional\nresistance in air pipes and water above the air distribution system. The\ncompressed air may be supplied through laterals or through a dedicated pipe\nsystem.\nii) Wash water Troughs:  The water used for washing the filters is collected\nin wash water toughs or gutters, which are placed above sand bed level. The\ntroughs may be of cast-iron, concrete, steel or wrought iron. They are placed at\na distance of 130 to 180 cm from edge to edge. The bottom of the trough is\nabout 45 to 75 cm above the sand bed. For efficient working, the troughs\nshould be large enough and should be laid at a suitable slope.\niii",

For efficient working, the troughs\nshould be large enough and should be laid at a suitable slope.\niii) Rate Control Devices:  There are various devices to control the rate of\nflow of water, which may be fitted at the outlet of the filter. They work on the\nprinciple of Venturi meter.\nCleaning of Filters: When water passes through the filter, there is head loss due to\nfrictional resistance. The difference in water levels in the filter and in the outlet pipe\nprovides an idea about the loss of head (Fig. 7.14). When the filter is clean, the head\nl o s s i s n e g l i g i b l e ( a b o u t 1 5 t o 3 0 c m ) . I t g o e s o n i n c r e a s i n g w i t h t i m e u n t i l t h e\nfrictional resistance offered by the filter media exceeds the static head of water above\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 113\nthe sand bed, due to the deposition of suspended matter in the top layer. The lower\npart of the filter media then acts more or less like a vacuum and water is sucked\nthrough the filter media rather than getting filtered by passing through it. The fall of\nliquid level in the piezometric tubes below the centre line of the under-drainage\nsystem indicates negative head. The negative head thus formed tends to release\ndissolved air and other gases present in the water, which sticks to the sand grains,\nseriously impairing the functioning of the filter. In case of rapid sand filters, the\npermissible loss of head is about 3.0 to 3.5 m and the permissible negative head is\nabout 120 cm.

    "ms of\nrapid sand filters are i) Mud balls and ii) Cracking of filters.\ni) Mud balls: Mud balls are normally formed near the top of the filter media,\nthough it is not uncommon to have them distributed throughout the filter.\nThese are formed as a consequence of insufficient washing of sand grains\nresulting in gelatinous film formed during filtration not being separated from\nthe sand grains during washing. They range in size from 25 to 50 mm and\nseriously impair the functioning of the filter. Mud balls are broken and\nremoved using rakes or other suitable instruments. Cleaning of filters with\nwater at high velocity will also help in getting rid of the problem.\nii) Cracking of Filters: Shrinkage of fine material contained in the top layer of\nthe filter may result in the formation of cracks in the filter. Such cracks are\nnormally prominent near wall junctions. The damaged portion of the filter\nmedia has to be replaced to get rid of this problem.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 114\nRate of Filtration: The main advantage of a rapid sand filter is its high rate of\nfiltration, which is about 3000 to 6000 litres per hour per square metre of filter area.\nThe high rate of filtration results in considerable saving of space for the installation of\nfilter.\nEfficiency of Rapid Sand Filters\ni) Bacterial Load: Rapid sand filters are less effective in the removal of\nbacterial load when compared to slow sand filters. They are expected to\nremove between 80 and 90 percent of bacterial load present in water.\nii) Colour:  These filters are highly efficient in removal of colour and the\nintensity of colour can be brought down below 10 on cobalt scale.\niii) Turbidity: Rapid sand filters are capable of removing turbidity to the\nextent of 35 to 40 ppm.

Automatic pressure filters are\nalso available now in the market in which washing of the filter is done automatically\nat pre-determined intervals of time or loss of head.\nPressure filters are not suitable for public water supply projects, but can be installed\nfor colonies of houses, industrial plants, private estates, swimming pools, railway\nstations etc.\nd) Double Filtration\nDouble filtration, involving filtration of water twice, can be used for better results.\nThis can be achieved either by allowing water to pass through two or more slow or\nrapid sand filters arranged in series, or by passing the water through a raid sand filter\nbefore sending it to a slow sand filter. In practice, the latter alternative is most\ncommonly adopted to increase the filtration rate of an existing slow sand filter. The\nrapid sand filter used in such a way is known as a ‘roughing’ filter. Coarse materials\nare used in the construction of roughing filters, resulting in rates of filtration as high\nas 7000 litre per hour per square metre of filter area. They generally do not\nnecessarily require water pre-treated with coagulant. Double filtration is usually\nadopted at places where there are constraints of land availability for construction of\nslow sand filters.

Silt and other contaminants present in the roof top rainwater can be\nremoved efficiently using these filters. The size of the filter can be decided based\nupon roof top area and the rainfall amount.\nLocally fabricated filters consisting of buckets or other containers filled with filter\nmedia such as coarse sand, charcoal, coconut fiber, pebbles and gravels may also be\nused to remove the debris and dirt form water that enters the tank in small scale\ndomestic roof top rainwater harvesting systems.

Common\nvessels used for small-scale water storage are plastic bowls, buckets, jerry cans, clay\nof ceramic jars, cement jars, old oil drums etc.  For storing larger quantities of water,\nthe system will usually require a bigger tank with sufficient strength and durability.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 117\nDifferent types of storage tanks feasible for storing roof top rainwater are given\nbelow.\n     Storage tanks\nT h e r e a r e u n l i m i t e d n u m b e r s o f o p t i o n s f o r t h e c o n s t r u c t i o n o f t h e s e t a n k s w i t h\nrespect to the shape (cylindrical, rectangular and square), the size (capacity from\n1,000 - 15,000 L. or even higher) and the material of construction (brick, stone,\ncement bricks, Ferro-cement, con",

Moreover, it is difficult to create enough storage space due to various\nconstraints. In such a situation, it is ideal to create the storage space to collect the\nrainfall per spell and utilize the same before the next spell. In this case,\nWater available from roof     =  Annual rainfall (in mm) X Area of roof (in sq m) X\n               Runoff coefficient for the roof\nWater available per spell of rainfall = Rainfall per spell X Area of roof (in sq m) X\nRunoff coefficient for the roof\n7.2.8 Collection Sump\nA small pit is normally dug in the ground beneath the tap of the storage tank and\nc o n s t r u c t e d i n b r i c k m a s o n r y t o m a k e a c h a m b e r , s o t h a t a v e s s e l c o u l d b e\nconveniently placed beneath the tap for collecting water form the storage tank.

In such cases, it may be\nmore economical to use rainwater to recharge ground water aquifers so that it can be\nextracted at times of need. Long-term rainfall records are necessary to ascertain the\nrainfall pattern.\n7.3.3 Intensity of Rainfall:  The maximum intensity of rainfall in mm/hr for a short\nduration (normally 20 min) will decide the peak flow to be harvested by the roof top\nrainwater harvesting system.

This will have obvious impacts on system specification.\n7.3.7 Number of Users:  This will greatly influence the requirements and design\nspecifications of the rainwater harvesting system.\n7.3.8 Cost: Cost is a major factor in any rainwater-harvesting scheme.\n7.3.9 Alternative Water Sources: Availability of alternative water sources can make\na significant difference to the usage pattern of the water collected using rainwater\nharvesting systems.  If a sustainable and safe ground water source is available within\neconomic distances, a rainwater harvesting system may provide a reliable supply of\nwater for a house/community for the majority of the year. On the other hand, where\nrainwater is to be stored and used only for domestic use, the pattern of use will\ndepend on the quality of water.\n7.3.10 Water management Strategy:  A judicious water management strategy is\nrequired for proper and optimum use of harvested water. In situations where there is\nstrong reliance on stored rainwater, there is need to control or manage the amount of\nwater being used so that it is available for a longer period.\n7.4 Feasibility of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting Systems\n7.4.1 Urban Area\nIn Urban area, water is mainly required for domestic and related uses, and is mostly\ndrawn from surface water bodies, rivers, streams and/or ground water sources.

The roof should be\naway from big trees to avoid accumulation of leaf litter and bird droppings. Thatched\nroofs are not suitable as roof catchments because the water collected from these roofs\ngets brownish colour and carries pieces of roof material.\nT h e s l o p e a n d s h a p e of t h e r o o f a r e a l s o i m p o r t a n t i n p l a n n i n g a r o o f t o p r a i n t o p\nrainwater harvesting system.  Water flows with high velocity on steep-sloped roofs,\ncausing overflow or wastage of water form gutters and filter.  Gentle slopes in the\nrange of 10 to 30 degrees are most suitable for smooth flow of water into the storage\ntank.

T h e s o u t h w e s t\nmonsoon reaches India in June and extends normally up to September.  The northeast\nmonsoon extends from October to December.

    "ds normally up to September.  The northeast\nmonsoon extends from October to December.  Kerala and north-eastern states benefit\nfrom both the monsoons and hence receive rainfall extending over a period of 7-8\nmonths.  Rest of the country receives rains during southwest monsoon, except Tamil\nNadu, which receives comparatively more rains during northeast monsoon. The\nrainfall is limited to 3-4 month in these regions. The average annual rainfall received\nalso varies across the country, from 200-250 mm in western Rajasthan to >3000 mm\nin Kerala and north-eastern States.\nThe amount and period of rainfall at a given place are important factors that determine\nthe period for which water will be required from RRHS. For example, at places where\nrainfall is received only during southwest monsoon (3-4 months), the period of water\nrequirement form RRHS could be longer than that of places in Kerala and north-\neastern States. Also, in low rainfall areas such as western Rajasthan and northern\nGujarat, roof size could become a limiting factor as households in these areas may\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 123\nrequire water for an extended dry period of 7-8 months.  Here, traditional water\nharvesting systems make use of open lands, adjacent to the house, as catchments areas\nfor domestic water harvesting systems.\n7.5.4 Space\nAmong all the components of roof top rainwater harvesting systems, storage tank is\nthe component occupying most space, and hence the space required for the system\ndepends on the size of the storage tank.  For a typical 10,000 litre tank, the minimum\nspace required is 3.0 x 3.0m.  Therefore, assessment of availability of space adjacent\nto the house shall be done giving due importance to the preferences of the household.\nStorage tanks located near the roof reduce the cost of down pipes.  The site should be\nclean, hygienic and away from cattle sheds to avoid contamination of stored water.\n7.6 Economic Viability\nA ty pi cal",

This\nworks out to Rs.2.34 to Rs.1.49 per litre of water stored. This is quite high when\ncompared to the free water available through government-sponsored schemes, where\ncommunity participation and labour are not required at the construction stage. Hence,\ninvestment to this extent is a costly option and may be unaffordable to many rural\nhouseholds.  The cost of roof top rainwater harvesting systems could be brought down\nto a certain extent by using local materials such as bamboo for gutters, down pipe and\nfi rs t f l ush pi pe.  Con tri b uti on f rom us ers coul d be al s o b e rai sed i n term s of l ab our\nand materials to meet a part of the investment.\nIt i s advi sabl e to h av e th e us er h ous eh ol d th em sel ves m eet a si zeabl e por ti on of th e\ncost of RRHS to ensure its sustainability and replicability. This would also encourage\nownership and appropriate maintenance of the system at the level of households.\nExtending soft loans repayable in easy instalments would be appropriate for this\npurpose. The existing Government schemes, which finance women self-help groups in\nrural areas such as the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh  and NABARD self-help group\nschemes, could be utilized for extending such loan facilities to the rural households.\n7.7 Social Acceptance\n7.7.1 Acceptance of Roof Water as Drinking Water\nColour, odour and taste are the three important considerations for people in choosing\nsources of drinking water.  Clean water without any odour and with a ‘good taste’ is\nusually preferred for dinking purpose.  In case of water used for cooking, water\nhaving lesser amounts of dissolved salts is p",
    "drinking water.  Clean water without any odour and with a ‘good taste’ is\nusually preferred for dinking purpose.  In case of water used for cooking, water\nhaving lesser amounts of dissolved salts is preferred, because it consumes less time to\nboil the food grains and vegetables.  As the rainwater contains very little dissolved\nsalts and is almost free from pollutants, it tastes ‘good’ and is suitable for drinking\nand cooking purposes.\nHowev er, i n roof top rai n water h arv es ti n g sy s tem s , water i s col l ected i n th e s torage\ntank during rainy season and is drawn from the system only after other sources like\nponds, wells and hand pumps dry up or become inaccessible to the household.  This\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 124\nmeans that the water collected in RRHS remains stored for a period of 3 to 6 months\nbefore it is actually used. This makes water from RRHS not readily acceptable to\nmany people. Therefore, awareness and education programmes need to be organized\non the potability of water when the system is appropriately maintained. People’s\nperceptions need to be given due importance during such programmes, to enable them\nto develop appropriate understanding of the system.\nDomestic water use varies from place to place depending on the culture and habits of\npeople as well as availability of water.  Water made available at the doorstep is likely\nto increase the water usage.  Increased water use would improve the cleanliness and\nhygiene within the household as well as improve the health of the people. Yet, people\nhave to be educated to draw water in controlled quantities so that they could benefit\nf r o m t h e s y s t e m t h r o u g h o u t t h e p e r i o d o f w a t e r s c a r c i t y t o w h i c h t h e s y s t e m i s\ndesigned.\n7.7.2 Willingness of Households to Participate\nDomestic Roof top Rainwater Harvesting Systems are meant for meeting the water\nneeds of individual households and are constructed rig",

Hence,\nproper care and maintenance of the system by the household is essential for a reliable\nsupply of good quality water.\nWillingness of household to participate in planning, construction and maintenance of\nsuch systems are very important for the success of the programme. The motivating\nfactors such as availability of sufficient water, economy and ease in maintenance,\nownership of the system etc., which encourages the people to participate should be\nidentified and proper orientation should be given.\n7.7.3 Traditional Practices of Roof Water Collection\nCollection of roof water on small scale from house roofs to meet the immediate\nhousehold needs is a traditional practice in some parts of India such as north-eastern\nstates, Rajasthan and eastern coastal areas of Tamil Nadu. Small vessels or drums are\nused to collect and store water. Locally available bamboo is split and used as gutters.\nExistence of such practices makes RRHS to meet long-term needs acceptable.\nH o w e v e r , t r a i n i n g a n d t r a n s f e r o f k n o w l e d g e o n s y s t e m a t i c a n d e c o n o m i c a l\nconstruction of these systems is required.\n7.8 Water Quality and Health\nRainwater is often used for drinking and cooking and hence it is vital that the highest\npossible quality standards are maintained. Rainwater, unfortunately, often does not\nmeet the World Health Organization (WHO) water quality guidelines. This does not\nmean that the water is unsafe to drink. It has been found that a favourable user\nperception of rainwater quality (not necessarily perfect water quality) makes an\nenormous difference to the acceptance of RWH as a water supply option. Generally,\nthe chemical quality of rainwater will fall within the WHO guidelines and rarely\npresents problems. There a",

Generally,\nthe chemical quality of rainwater will fall within the WHO guidelines and rarely\npresents problems. There are two main issues when looking at the quality and health\naspects of domestic rainwater harvesting systems.\nRoof Top Rainwater Harvesting\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 125\n7.8.1 Bacteriological Water Quality\nRainwater can become contaminated by faeces entering the tank from the catchment\narea. It is advised that the catchment surface always be kept clean. Rainwater tanks\nshould be designed to protect the water from contamination by leaves, dust, insects,\nvermin and other industrial or agricultural pollutants. Tanks should be located away\nfrom trees, with good-fitting lids and kept in good condition. Incoming water should\nbe filtered or screened, or allowed to settle to take out foreign matter. Water, which is\nrelatively clean, on entry to the tank, will usually improve in quality if allowed to be\ni n s i d e th e ta n k f or s om e ti m e . B a c te ri a en te ri n g th e ta n k wi l l di e of f r a pi dl y i f th e\nwater is relatively clean. Algae will grow inside a tank if sufficient sunlight is\navailable for photosynthesis. Keeping a tank dark and in a shady spot will prevent\nalgae growth and also keep the water cool. As already mentioned, there are a number\nof ways of diverting the dirty ‘first flush’ water away from the storage tank. The area\nsurrounding a RWH structure should be kept in good sanitary condition, fenced off to\nprevent animals fouling the area or children playing around the tank. Any pools of\nwater gathering around the tank should be drained and filled.\n7.8.2 Insect Vectors\nThere is a need to prevent insect vectors from breeding inside the tank.

Mosquito-proof screens should be fitted to all openings.\nSome practitioners recommend the use of 1 to 2 teaspoons of household kerosene in a\ntank of water, which provides a film to prevent mosquitoes settling on the water.\n7.8.3 Water Treatment\nThere are several simple methods of treatment for water to made suitable for drinking\nx Boiling water will kill any harmful bacteria which may be present\nx Adding chlorine in the right quantity (35ml of sodium hypochlorite per 1000\nlitres of water) will disinfect the water\nx Slow sand filtration will remove any harmful organisms.\nx A recently developed technique called SODIS (Solar Disinfections) utilises\nplastic bottles, which are filled with water and placed in the sun for one full\nday. The back of the bottle is painted black.\nThe reasons for variations in chemical constituents and bacteriological properties of\nwater from RRHS could be many, the most important ones of which are listed below:\n Even though the water flows over the house roof for a short distance, it may\nd i s s o l v e s o m e c h e m i c a l s d e p o s i t e d o n t h e r o o f o r t h e r e s i d u e s o f c h e m i c a l\nreactions between the atmospheric gases and the roof material.\n I n g e n e r a l , r a i n w a t e r i s p u r e a n d f r e e f r o m c o n t a m i n a t i o n .

These tests help in verifying the presence of pathogenic bacteria.\n7.8.5 Disinfecting Water\nDisinfecting is the process of killing the disease-causing micro organisms present in\nthe water.  This can be done either by boiling the water in a vessel before consuming\nit or by dissolving bleaching power in required quantity to the water stored in the\ntank.\nFor disinfecting using bleaching powder, the general dosage recommended is 10\nmilligrams of bleaching powder containing 25% of free chlorine per litre of water.\nThis meets the required standard of 2.5 milligrams of chlorine per litre of water.\nAfter adding the bleaching power, the water shall be st",

IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nArtificial recharge structures are constructed mostly with the objective of augmenting\nground water resources and/or to improve its quality. Assessment of impacts of the\nartificial recharge schemes implemented is essential to assess the efficacy of\nstructures constructed for artificial recharge and helps in identification of cost-\neffective recharge mechanisms for optimal recharge into the ground water system. It\nalso helps to make necessary modifications in site selection, design and construction\nof structures in future.\nImpact assessment may require monitoring of the recharge structure, ground water\nregime, changes in pattern of water supply, cropping pattern, crop productivity and/or\nwater quality. In recent years, tracers such as Tritium, Rhodomine B, fluorescent dyes\nand environmental isotopes are also being used for demarcating the area benefited by\nartificial r",

In recent years, tracers such as Tritium, Rhodomine B, fluorescent dyes\nand environmental isotopes are also being used for demarcating the area benefited by\nartificial recharge structures.\nThe methodology of impact assessment is highly site-specific and can vary\nconsiderably depending upon various factors such as hydrogeological set-up and\nground water utilization pattern. General guidelines for impact assessment of artificial\nrecharge structures are discussed briefly in the following sections.\n8.1 Monitoring of Recharge Structures\nSurface structures such as percolation ponds, check dams and cement plugs need to be\nmonitored at regular intervals to assess the actual storage created in the structures,\nperiod of impounding, capacity utilization of the structure, rate of percolation and\ns i l t a t i o n p r o b l e m s i f a n y . Q u a n t i f i c a t i o n o f s t o r a g e i n t h e s t r u c t u r e s m a y r e q u i r e\nsetting up of monitoring devices within the structures. Devices such as gauges for\narea-capacity analysis are commonly used in surface recharge structures. Daily\nmonitoring records are preferred for realistic assessment of storage created by\nmultiple fillings of the structures. Evaporation and seepage losses from the structures\nare also to be accounted properly to evaluate the recharge efficiency of the structures.\nIn case of subsurface structures, the intake water supplied to the structures is\nmeasured by suitable measuring devices. Appropriate measuring devices such as flow\nm e t e r s a n d ‘ V ’ n o t c h e s c a n b e u s e d f o r m e a s u r e m e n t . D a i l y r e c o r d s o f s u c h\nmeasurements help quantify the amount of water utilized for recharge purpose.\n8.2 Water Level Monitoring\nThe objective of water level monitoring is to study the effect of artificial recharge on\nthe natural ground water system.

    "level monitoring is to study the effect of artificial recharge on\nthe natural ground water system. The monitoring system should be designed\njudiciously to monitor impact of individual structures which can further be extended\nto monitor the impact of groups of such structures in the area where artificial recharge\nis being done. Monitoring of water levels during the planning stage of artificial\nrecharge projects helps in assessment of the ground water conditions of the area and\nhelps in identification of the most suitable method for ground water augmentation. A\nproperly designed observation well network is used for understanding the ground\nwater flow pattern and the spatial and temporal changes in water levels/potentiometric\nheads in the area.\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 135\nDuring the planning and feasibility study stage, the observation well network is\ng e n e r al l y of l ow w el l d en s i ty b u t s p r e a d ov e r a l a r g e a r e a wi th th e p ri m a ry ai m of\ndefining the boundaries of the aquifer to be recharged and to know the hydraulic\ncharacteristics of the natural ground water system.  After identification of the feasible\nartificial recharge structures, the observation well network is redefined in a smaller\narea with greater well density.\nFor effective monitoring of the changes in the water levels due to artificial recharge,\nthe network should have observation wells near the center of the recharge facility, at a\nsufficient distance from the recharge facility to observe composite effects and also\nnear the limits of hydrological boundaries. If the aquifer being recharged is overlain\nby confining /semi-confining layers, piezometers should be installed to monitor the\nwater levels of overlying and underlying aquifers separately to study the effects in\nboth the aquifers. In cases where surface water bodies are hydraulically connected\nwith the aquifers being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles",
    "ately to study the effects in\nboth the aquifers. In cases where surface water bodies are hydraulically connected\nwith the aquifers being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles of\nboth surface water and ground water.\nDemarcation of the zone of influence of the artificial recharge structure is one of the\nmain objectives monitoring in the context of artificial recharge projects. The\nfollowing observations are generally associated with the area benefited by an artificial\nrecharge structure:\n1. Well hydrographs in the area benefited will have a flat apex during the\nperiod when there is water in the recharge structure (tank, pit etc.).\n2. Wells located outside the zone of influence normally show an angular apex\nd u ri n g th e p e ri od of r e ch a r g e , w h e r e a s th os e s i tua te d w i th i n th e z on e of\ninfluence have a flatter apex.\n3. The recession limbs of well hydrographs close to a recharge structure\nnormally have gentle gradients as compared to those located far off.\n4.

Furthermore, crops with high water\nrequirements are more likely to be grown in the zone of influence.\n5. Well yields in the zone of influence will normally be higher when\ncompared to those outside it.  Wells in benefited zone may have more\nsustainability in lean period than those located outside.\nThe behaviour of water table / piezometric head profile prepared from the data\ncollected from the observation well network over a period of time can clearly\nestablish the efficacy of the artificial recharge scheme. Answers to questions related\nto the extent of the area benefited and the quantification of ground water\naugmentation could also be worked out from such data. The study of fluctuation over\ntime for both surface and ground water levels in the same area may also indicate\nwhether the ground water augmentation is taking place as",

The study of fluctuation over\ntime for both surface and ground water levels in the same area may also indicate\nwhether the ground water augmentation is taking place as envisaged or not. In case\nany deviation is observed, the reasons for the same could be identified and necessary\nremedial measures taken up.\n8.3 Water Quality Monitoring\nA proper evaluation of potential water quality and aquifer quality problems associated\nwith artificial recharge is a key component of a ground water recharge scheme. The\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 136\ndevelopment of reliable pre-, operational and post-operational monitoring programs is\nan integral part of the development of a successful ground water recharge scheme.\nA reliable water quality monitoring system for an artificial recharge scheme will\ninvolve i) Evaluation of existing water quality data, ii) pre-operational monitoring,\niii) operational monitoring and iv) post-operational monitoring.\n8.3.1 Evaluation of Existing Water Quality Data\nThe first step that should be followed in evaluating the potential water quality\nproblems associated with a proposed ground water recharge project is to obtain\ndetailed information on the chemical characteristics of the proposed recharge waters.\nA critical examination of the existing data on the waters that would be recharged to\nthe aquifer should be made to first determine their reliability and representativeness.\nIn case the available data is not consi dered to be reliable, collecti on and analysis of\nsource water samples may be done afresh.\n8.3.2 Pre-operational Monitoring\nThe augmentation of recharge by surface waters and their associated contaminants\ncan greatly increase the potential for ground water quality problems due to the\nincreased hydraulic and contaminant loading. The characterization of ground water\nquality is often not adequately done to properly evaluate potential ground water and\naquifer quality problems associat",
    "increased hydraulic and contaminant loading. The characterization of ground water\nquality is often not adequately done to properly evaluate potential ground water and\naquifer quality problems associated with a ground water recharge project. it is\nimportant to properly assess how the variable parameters in sampling such as bore\nhole volume purged and rate of purging before sampling influences the composition\nof the samples. Chemical parameters of particular importance in reliably assessing\nground water quality samples are the redox conditions within the aquifer and the\npresence of suspended solids in the samples. Because of the chemistry of ferrous and\nferric iron, small changes in the redox (oxidation reduction) characteristics of the\nsample as a result of the introduction of oxygen into the sample during sampling can\ndrastically change the chemical characteristics of the samples. Hence, it is important\nto maintain the oxygen concentrations in a sample collected from an aquifer the same\nas that of the aquifer. Failure to do s o coul d readily change the distributi on between\ndissolved and particulate forms of many trace contaminants of water quality concern.\nThe presence of suspended solids in a water sample from an aquifer is a clear\nindication that the sampling well has been improperly constructed and developed and\n/or the sampling procedure used, especially the purging, has been improperly done.\nAquifers typically do not contain large amounts of suspended material. Aquifer\nsamples that contain suspended material are unreliable to properly characterize\nchemical characteristics of the ground waters within the aquifer at the point and time\nof sampling.\nIt is also important that the sampling program for the ground water is properly\ndeveloped to reflect the site specific hydrogeology of various principal components of\nthe aquifer. Failure to do so could readily lead to erroneous conclusions concerning\nthe chemical characteristics of the aquifer waters and the chemical",
    "hydrogeology of various principal components of\nthe aquifer. Failure to do so could readily lead to erroneous conclusions concerning\nthe chemical characteristics of the aquifer waters and the chemical reactions that can\ntake place within the aquifer upon introduction of recharge waters to it. Depending on\nthe situation, at least one year and often several years of data may be needed to\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 137\nreliably characterize the aquatic system of interest.

O n c e i t\nbecomes clear that the characteristics of a particular recharge water source and aquifer\nare predictable with a high degree of certainty based on past monitoring results, it\nshould then be possible to reduce the frequency and duration of pre-operational\nmonitoring. If, however, it is not possible to make these predictions reliably because\nof the high variability in the systems, proceeding with the operation of the proposed\nrecharge project could be met with significant problems in detecting incipient water\nquality problems before they adversely impact large parts of the aquifer.\n8.3.3 Operational Monitoring\nWith the initiation of the recharge activities, a significant increase in the frequency of\nsampling, especially near the point of recharge, should occur. Actually the operational\nsampling program should be initiated several months before actual recharge starts in\norder to evaluate the ability to conduct the monitoring program with the facilities and\npersonnel available. If the pre-operational monitoring program has been passive ,",
    "ore actual recharge starts in\norder to evaluate the ability to conduct the monitoring program with the facilities and\npersonnel available. If the pre-operational monitoring program has been passive , then\ni t shoul d, at the time of ini tiati on of recharge, becom e an active program , where the\ndata is examined in detail as soon as it is available for the purpose of determining its\nreliability and any potential problems that are developing with the recharge project. In\naddition to chemical and microbiological measurements in the recharge waters as well\nas within the aquifer, detailed monitoring of the hydraulic characteristics of the\ninjection / infiltration system should be conducted to determine the changes in the\nhydraulic characteristics of the recharge system and the aquifer in the vicinity of the\nrecharge. In addition to monitoring the chemical contaminants in the recharge waters\na s w el l as a q ui f e r , c on s i d e r a ti on s h oul d b e gi v en t o th e c on ta m i n an t t r a n s f orm a ti on\nproducts that might be formed in the recharge water. An area of particular concern in\nthe recharge waters is whether there is sufficient BOD in these waters to exhaust the\ndissolved oxygen in the aquifer waters for those aquifer systems that are oxic prior to\ninitiation of recharge. Bore hole dissolved oxygen measurements should be made at\nfrequent intervals at various distances from the point of recharge in order to detect\nincipient dissolved oxygen depletion that could lead to its exhaustion from the\nrecharge waters. Since, in general, except for nitrate-related issues, anoxic conditions\nin aquifers tend to lead to poor water quality, care should be taken to prevent the\nrecharge waters from becoming anoxic within the aquifer. Failure to do so could\nreadily result in iron, manganese and hydrogen sulphide problems. If problems of this\ntype start to develop, it may be necessary to add dissolved oxygen either directly or\nthrough the introduction of hydrogen pero",

If problems of this\ntype start to develop, it may be necessary to add dissolved oxygen either directly or\nthrough the introduction of hydrogen peroxide, in the recharge waters in order to\nprevent problems of this type from occurring.\nOnce the operational monitoring program data have become stabilized, i.e. are\npredictable based on past monitoring results, then the frequency of operational and\npost-operational monitoring can be decreased. This will likely take several years of\noperation, however, for fairly constant composition recharge waters and fairly\nhomogeneous aquifer system with respect to its hydrogeologic and chemical\ncharacteristics.\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 138\nThe type of water quality monitoring programme depends on the specific problem\nbeing studied, such as changes in ground water quality, effect of soil salination,\nprevention of any contamination etc.  The samples to be collected will also depend on\nthe purpose and are generally categorized into a) Indicative, b) Basic and c)\nComprehensive.  Indicative samples are collected at 1 to 4 months intervals and are\nused to ascertain the presence of recharged water in the aquifer.  Basic samples are\ntaken at monthly intervals for wells already influenced by recharge to determine the\neffect of recharge on ground water quality and the purification provided by flow\nthrough the soil and aquifer system.  Comprehensive samples are taken at intervals of\n6 months to 1 year for observation wells and production wells to determine water\nquality with respect to specific standards for intended water use.\n8.3.4 Post-operational Monitoring\nWhen groundwater recharge is terminated, it is important that the monitoring of the\naquifer be continued until the waters in the aquifer stabilize in composition.

The construction of tank was\ncompleted in June, 1995 and since then it stored water every year.\n8.4.3 Analysis of Efficiency\nMonitoring of the tank was commenced on 24-6-95 and continued up to 1998. The\ntank balance analysis with regard to the gross storage and percolation fraction etc.\nwere done for the entire period of impounding. The inflow into the tank as observed\nduring various periods was appropriately accounted. Evaporation losses were\ncalculated on daily basis and visible seepage was measured. Thus net percolation\namount contributing to the ground water recharge was calculated as per the procedure\ndiscussed earlier.\nA gauge of 6 metre height was installed and daily monitoring of tank level was done.\nThe contour plan of the tank submergence was prepared, immediately after the\nImpact Assessment\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 140\ncompletion of construction, as shown in Fig. 8.1. The area-capacity curves were then\ndrawn showing the area of submergence in thousand sq m (ThM 2) and storage\ncapacity in thousand cubic metre (TCM) with respect to gauge reading as shown in\nFig. 8.2.\nThe efficiency of the percolation tank in monsoon (June-Oct) and non-monsoon\n(November onwards) of  three  years has been calculated in the range of  95-98% and\n92 -95% respectively.

The water level in the tank and hydrographs of 5 wells were\ndrawn as shown in Fig.8.3. It is observed that the hydrographs of wells located up to\n1.5 km away from the percolation tank are showing nearly flat apex between August\nto M arch .

The specific\nobservations and enquiries with the local farmers have also revealed that the impact of\nthis tank is visible up to 1.5 km downstream. The area of influence is estimated to be\nabout 80 ha. up to a distance of 1.5 km downstream of the structure (Fig. 8.4)).\nThe benefited area is cultivated with cash crops. Sugarcane is",

Sugarcane is also grown in the area.\nAbout 25 dug wells in this zone have been benefited due to artificial recharge from\nthis percolation tank. The farmers in the area have switched over to more water\nintensive crops and new dug wells are being constructed which will bring more area\nunder ground water irrigation. The recharge from percolation tank has resulted in the\nsustained yield of ground water during the summer. The rise in pre monsoon water\nlevel up to 2 m was observed during 1996 and up to 6 m in 1997 with respect to 1995.\nThe increase in pumpage hours of dug wells by 2-3 hours per day during Rabi and 1-2\nhours in summer was also observed. It is estimated that an additional recharge of\nabout  150 TCM can bring up to 30 ha of more area under assured irrigation during\nKhariff and Rabi seasons, considering an average crop water requirement of 0.50\nm/year.\n8.4.5 Impact of Recharge on Chemical Quality of Ground Water\nThe impact of ground water recharge on the quality of ground water was also studied.\nThe chemical analysis of percolation tank water and water samples collected from 4\nobservation wells located within the area of tank’s influence were used for the study.\nThe comparison of concentration of various elements present in the percolation tank\nwater, native and augmented ground water  is shown in Table 8.3\nA perusal of Table 8.3 indicates that\n1. The pH of tank water is almost neutral (7.1). The overall quality of tank water is\nsuperior to the ground water quality.\n2. Concentration of all the elements in percolation tank is significantly less than\nground water  except concentration of K+ and  SO4\n=  which is more in tank water.\n3.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF RECHARGE SCHEMES\nEconomic viability is a critical parameter to be ascertained before taking a decision to\nimplement any artificial recharge scheme. The appraisal of economic viability has to\nbe carried out after taking into account all possible expenses including those for\ninvestigation, source water (conveyance, treatment), construction of recharge\nstructures, operation and maintenance etc. All benefits should be appropriately\naccounted for and assessed in order to decide the acceptability of the scheme as per its\npriority in the overall scheme of development. Economic analysis of artificial\nrecharge projects aims at ascertaining their economic and financial viability.\n9.1 Benefit Cost Analysis\nIt is important to carry out the Benefit Cost Analysis for all major public works before\na decision is taken on the allocation of funds. The Benefit Cost Analysis presents the\nquantifiable efforts, environmental and social aspects of any public projects in money\nterms.\nThe analysis of the financial benefits and costs requires expressing the cash flow\nelements under the non-financial operations in comparable terms. Costs are related to\ninvestments occurring during the lifetime of the project.  However, benefits originate\nf r o m t h e p r o d u c t i v e u s e o f t h e p r o j e c t s .  T h e r e f o r e , b o t h c o s t s a n d b e n e f i t s a r e\nexpressed in quantitative terms and translated into monetary terms by using market\nvalues of the inputs and outputs concerned.  Actually, the costs and benefits occur at\ndifferent points of time. In order to make them comparable, it is customary to express\nboth in terms of their present value by applying the appropriate discounting factors.\nAfter accounting both the costs and benefits against their market values,",
    "m comparable, it is customary to express\nboth in terms of their present value by applying the appropriate discounting factors.\nAfter accounting both the costs and benefits against their market values, appropriate\ncriteria are applied to determine the profitability of the project.\nThe Benefit Cost analysis of the projects is sometimes also called Project Appraisal.\nThis Project Appraisal is done before the decision is taken to invest, whereas\ne v al u a ti on s om e ti m es i s d on e to a n al y z e th e p e rf or m an c e an d ef f ec ts of th e p r oj e c t\nafter it has been executed.\nT h e m os t i m p or ta n t f a c tor s of p r oj e c t a p p r ai s al ar e F i n an ci al , E c on om i c an d S oci al\nBenefit Cost Analysis next to Institutional, Environmental, and Social impact\nassessments.\n9.1.1 Financial Benefit Cost Analysis\nTh e f i nan ci al Ben ef i t Cos t an aly si s vi ews any proj ect f rom th e poi n t of vi ew of th e\nINVESTOR. The analysis would suggest/indicate the investor whether it is\nworthwhile to invest in the project in comparison of other investment opportunities.\nIn practice, the investor may be a private person, a non-government Organization, or a\ngovernment institution.\nIn evaluating the advantages of an investment opportunity, it is essential to give\nproper weightages to two major aspects, i.e., Liquidity Analysis and Profitability\nAnalysis.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 153\nThe liquidity analysis would demonstrate whether, for the entire lifetime of the\nproject, receipts from equity capital and borrowing plus the annual income (Cash\ninflows) will be sufficient to meet the obligations for payments to be made (Cash\noutflows.)\nCash inflows, in this context, comprise the following elements.\ni) Investment funds, which may consist of equity capital or loans,\nii) Loans and credit, during operation, and\niii) Revenues from sales and subsidies.\nOn the other hand, Cash Outflows to be consid",

A number of methods have been developed to measure the\nprof i tabili ty of i nves tm en ts . Th e com m only us ed m eth ods are, i ) Ben efi t Cos t Ra ti o\n(B/C) Ratio), ii) Net Present Value (NPV) and iii) Internal Rate of Return (IRR).\nThese methods are described below in brief.\na) Benefit Cost Ratio: The Benefit Cost (B-C) ratio, also known as ‘Profitability\nIndex’ (PI) or ‘Desirability Factor’ is being widely used in the initial stages of\nproject appraisal.  It is defined as:\nB-C Ratio =       ---------------------------------------\nIf B-C ratio > 1, the project is considered to be attractive and profitable.\nIf B-C ratio <1, the project would not earn the inputs back and are thus not\nrecommended for execution.\nLimitation:\nWithout more information such as net benefits of running costs, cost\nescalation considered for gross benefits etc., the B C ratio is not well defined.\nHence, NPV and IRR should be considered in addition to B C ratio for proper\nevaluation of  projects.\nPresent value of total benefits\nPresent value of total costs\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 154\nb) Net Pr es ent Val ue (NP V) : Th e Net Pres en t Val ue i s uni quely def i ned an d\nwidely used in the selection of ground water development projects and\nartificial recharge project",

It is defined as the difference between the present\nvalue of total benefits and the present value of total costs. In this method, the\ninflows and outflows expected in future are discounted for a change in the\nvalue of money. Accordingly, cash flows expected in future years are\ndiscounted and their values at the beginning of the project are arrived at.\nDiscounting presumes that money, like the other factors of production, has a\ncost. Discounting is done at the interest rate, which is the cost of capital,\nkn own as th e di s coun t ra te. In teres t ra te an d di scoun t ra te are p rac ti cal ly th e\nsame, the only difference being the point of view. Interest assumes looking\nfrom the present to the future, whereas discounting look backwards from the\nfuture to the present.\nThe net present value of investment proposal is computed as\nn\nt\nt = 0\ncft\n( 1 k)\u000e¦\nWhere\ncft = Cash flow occurring at the end of year’t’,\nn = Life of the project and\nk = Cost of capital used as the discount rate.\nIf NPV> 0 (Positive), the project is considered to be profitable and will yield\nmore benefits than the investments.\nThe following example describes the procedure for calculation of NPV.\nAssuming ‘n’ as 5 years, ‘k’ as 10%\nYears           0         1         2           3          4          5\nNet Cash flow      -1000     200     200       250      350      400\n   NPV =\n= 22.1\nHence, the project can be accepted as the NPV is positive.\nc) Internal Rate of Return (IRR):   Though the NPV, which gives the net\npresent value in absolute terms and Benefit Cost ratio, which gives the ratio of\nprofit to cost consider the time value of money, neither of these methods\nindicate the rate of return. The Internal Rate of Return is a measure of the\nreturn on the investment that the project yields.  It is th",

Economic Benefit Cost Analysis\nThe main component of economic benefit cost analysis is to evaluate the resources in\na national context. The analysis views it from the national point of view such that the\nbenefits add to the national economy.\nT h e r e a r e c e r tai n as p e c ts , w h i ch a r e to b e f ul l y u n d e r s to od f or s u ch an al y s e s to b e\ncorrect and realistic. The effects of the projects such as external effects, valuation of\nbenefits and costs, labor wages and perfect completion are to be studied in detail.\nThough these effects constitute a cost or benefit to the society, they are not reflected\nin the project's financial receipts or in expenditures. In addition to this, some aspects\nof e c ol ogi cal d am a g e an d p ol l u ti on of s oi l , w a te r or a i r m ay h av e t o b e ta k en i n to\naccount in the analysis. It follows that the valuation inputs and outputs of the project\ndiffer in financial and economic analysis.  Hence, it is customary to introduce certain\nconversion factors to transform financial prices into economic prices.\n9.1.2.1 Conversion Factors\nThe financial analysis simply uses the market prices of inputs and outputs whereas in\neconomic analysis, the prices that express the real scarcity of the inputs and outputs\nhave to be used.

In many cases, however, it is neither possible nor practical to use\nspecific standard conversion factors.\n9.1.2.2 Capital and Interest\nT h e v a l u a t i o n o f c a p i t a l i n t e r m s o f t h e r a t e o f i n t e r e s t o r t h e r a t e o f d i s c o u n t\nconstitutes the economist’s interest for evaluating any project proposals.  Sometimes,\nit becomes beyond the limits of the planner to determine the economic rate of interest\n(accounting rate of interest). In fact, a responsible government agency should\ndetermine the rate of interest to be used in the economic analysis in such a way that it\nhelps in adopting a uniform rate for all projects and the results of the analysis\ncomparable.\n9.1.2.3 Economic Appraisal\nThe economical appraisal of any ground water development/recharge project is\ncritical as the benefits are not only indirect but also time-consuming. Certain\nguidelines for economic appraisal are summarized below:\na. The inputs and outputs should be distinguished as ‘tradables’ and ‘non-\ntradables’.\nb. The assumption always is that the project under consideration will not\nchange the price of the output.\nc. Compared to the calculation in financial prices, some adjustments have to\nbe made by applying appropriate conversion factors converting financial\nprices into economic prices.\nd. The economic analysis should not only consider the effects for the\nproducer, but also for the user.\ne. Labor and wages under skilled and unskilled categories have a special\nsignificance in the valuation for economic analysis.

Although the computational part of the appraisal is rather straightforward,\nthe essential purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the project has a\npositive effect on the efficient application of national resources.\ng. The outcome of the economic appraisal of a development project is\ndecisive for the acceptance of the project.\nh. If the project is acceptable from the economic point of view but not from\nthe financial, it implies that the project will contribute to an efficient\napplication for national resources with additional requirement of financial\nsupport.\ni. If the project yields attractive returns to the Government but does not make\na c o n t r i b u t i o n t o t h e e f f i c i e n t u s e o f n a t i o n a l r e s o u r c e s , i t r e q u i r e s\nadditional policy measures to rectify the situation.\n9.1.3 Social Benefit Cost Analysis\nThe financial and economic benefit cost analyses are concerned mainly with the\nprofitability of investments and on the efficient use of national resources.

In such cases, social justice has not\noccurred.  In other words, not only the growth but the distribution of benefits is\nimportant.  This is the essence of Social Benefit Cost analysis.\nThe task becomes easy if the impact of the development project on the distribution of\nwelfare and the proper beneficiaries are identified.

It is also to be noted that the effective use of\nground water is attained when the difference between benefits and costs is maximized\nin positive direction over time. In fact, the water pumped in the current period results\nin lowered water table in future periods.

Hence, the change in the user cost\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 159\nover a time is dependent upon the discount rate and the effects of ground water\nstorage on pumping costs.\n9.2.2 Steady State Pumping Condition\nIn certain circumstances, over-exploitation of ground water may be optimal and\ne f f i c i e n t f r om e c o n om i c p oi n t o f v i e w .

Of course, it is evident that the over draft\nconditions could not be continued indefinitely.\nIn some situations, the ground water level will be lowered until a point is reached at\nwhich the costs of extraction are greater than the benefits generated from various uses\nto which the water has been put.  At this point, it is not economical to abstract ground\nwater at rates greater than the recharge rate. Thus, the relative magnitude of costs of\npumping and benefits ensure that only the annual recharge is being extracted. This\nmeans that the long-term pumping rates should not exceed long term recharge rates\nfor a given aquifer. This ultimate hydrologic condition is referred to as the Steady\nState (i.e., the difference between the recharge rate and the extraction rate equals zero)\n9.2.3 Artificial Recharge Component\nFor obtaining the economics of artificial recharge of ground water, an artificial\nrecharge component is to be included in the analysis.  Additionally, the source water\ncost and the benefits of use must be also be accounted for.

However, economic considerations make some particular\nmethods viable in a particular area or for a particular aquifer. Consequently, it is\npossible to estimate upper limits of quantities of recharge through each artificial\nrecharge structure based on studies carried out in different hydrogeological set-ups.\nSome of the typical recharge estimates are given below in general form with field\nexamples from alluvial unconfined/semi confined aquifer systems.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 160\n9.2.4.1 Check Dam & Percolation Tank\ni) Average water spread area         = 'a' Hectares\nii) Seepage Rate                              = 'b' Cu m/sec/million sq m of wetted\n                                                                    perimeter\niii) Inflow and storage period           = 'c' Days\niv) Quantity of induced recharge in MCM\na X 10 X b X 3600 X 24 X c\nAs a case example, assuming the water spread area of each check dam/percolation\ntank as 10 hectares, inflow and storage period of 100 days, monsoon seepage rate as\n2.6 cu m/sec/million sq m of wetted perimeter and considering 4 to 5 floods during\nthe rainy season, surface water recharge of nearly 2.25 MCM through each structure\ncould be considered as realistic.

This attempt will enhance the ground water recharge, reduce soil erosion\nand improve the health of the watershed.\nWatershed management through soil management and water conservation methods\nprovides an enhanced ground water recharge into the flow system.  Therefore, it is\nrecommended that appropriate fund allocation for watershed management should be\nprovided.\nMonitoring of the ground water regime for assessing the sustainability of the project\nobjectives and benefits requires certain committed funds.

As a result, the users have to periodically\nreplace/repair the pumps and in many cases re-drill tube wells. This phenomenon,\nwhich has now become common in many parts of the country results in very high\noperational costs toward ground water development over a period of time.\nAugmentation of ground water resources in such areas will not only help in bringing\nup or in stabilizing of water levels but will also reduce the user's financial\ncommitments toward the replacement of pumps or re-drilling of tube wells.\nSince artificial recharge of ground water is a time-consuming process, the benefits\nwould be felt only over a period of time and will mostly be of indirect nature, as the\nmeasures adopted are mainly oriented towards protecting and improving the natural\nground water environment.\nIt is fair to assume that once the aquifer system is augmented with additional recharge\ncomponent, the institutional finance for ground water development will be available\nto the users. The indirect benefits, which are economical as well as social, could be\nsummarized as below:\na. Control over further depletion of ground water levels, obviating the need\nfor re",

Environmental improvements helping in reduction of pollution hazards.\n9.2.7 Financial Appraisal of the Benefits\nIt is slightly elusive to view the indirect benefits in real financial terms.  In order to\nhave a near-realistic assessment, the financial amounts are shown in general form\nbelow.\ni) Considering 'Z' MCM of additional recharge to ground water which\noth erwi s e goes as s urf ace Run of f , i ts total v al ue ev en at a rate of Rs .\n0.1 per 1 m3 works out to rupees 'R1.'\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 163\nii) The replacement of pumps, say every 5 years for about 100 tube wells\nper year result in saving of Rupees 'R2' per year (Cost of the pump\naround Rs. 7,500).\niii) On an average, 100 tube wells are re-drilled every year.

    "ghtly enlarged to suit the ground water\nrecharge projects, which are mainly financed by State or Central Government\nDepartments.

Application of\nthis criterion is essential to determine the profitability of the project. For working out\na B/C ratio, it is customary to take the ratio of total benefits to the Annual Cost of\nexpenditure (in Rupees 'AR') for the ground water development projects.\nEconomic Evaluation of Recharge Schemes\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 164\nThis annual cost of expenditure includes i) Interest loss at the market rate of the total\ncost, ii) Maintenance & Repair charges at the feasible percentage rate of the total cost\niii) Depreciation of civil works at the rate permissible, and iv) Some miscellaneous\nexpenditure at a reasonable percentage of the total cost.\nThe above approach is detailed below for the estimation of B/C Ratio (Table 9.2)\nTable 9.2 Computation of Annual Cost of Expenditure\nA.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\nPeriodic maintenance of artificial recharge structures is essential because infiltration\ncapacity reduces rapidly as a result of silting, chemical precipitation and accumulation\nof organic matter. In case of surface spreading structures, annual maintenance consists\nof scraping the infiltration surfaces to remove accumulated silt and organic matter. In\nthe case of injection wells, periodic maintenance of the system consists of pumpin",
    ", annual maintenance consists\nof scraping the infiltration surfaces to remove accumulated silt and organic matter. In\nthe case of injection wells, periodic maintenance of the system consists of pumping\nand /or flushing with a mildly acidic solution to remove encrusting chemical\nprecipitates and bacterial growths on the well screens. The intervals between periodic\ncleanings can be extended by converting injection wells into dual purpose wells.\nHowever, in the case of spreading structures constructed with an overflow or outlet\nmechanism, annual desilting is a must. Structural maintenance is normally carried out\neither by government agencies or through initiatives of stakeholders.\nSuccess of artificial recharge schemes and related developmental activities primarily\ndepend on the cooperation of the community and hence, should be managed at the\nlocal level. From a basin management perspective, the division of a basin into many\nm i c r o - c a t c h m e n t s i s , h e n c e , a n e s s e n t i a l r e c o g n i t i o n o f t h e c o m m u n i t y r o l e . T h e\nsuccess of implementation and optimal utilisation of the schemes depend on\nparticipation and active contribution of the public.\nSeveral issues are to be considered in the operation and maintenance of artificial\nrecharge structures. These have been categorised as issues of high concern and\nmoderate concern (ASCE, 2001). Safety, optimisation techniques and programs, value\nof wet-dry cycles, frequency of pond cleaning and condition of filters attached to the\nstructures fall under issues of high concern, whereas security issues and rising ground\nwater levels are among those of moderate concern in this regard.\n10.1 Operational Data Requirements\nRealistic estimates of the quantum of water entering and leaving the recharge\narea/basin/sub-basin are essential for assessing the volume of water that is recharged.\nS t r e am g a u gi n g s ta ti on s i n s tr e am s a r e n ee d e d i f n a tu r al f l ows or a c om b i n a",
    "area/basin/sub-basin are essential for assessing the volume of water that is recharged.\nS t r e am g a u gi n g s ta ti on s i n s tr e am s a r e n ee d e d i f n a tu r al f l ows or a c om b i n a ti on of\nn atural f l ow an d im por ted wa ter are b ei ng rech arged. In cas e th e en ti re water b ei ng\nrecharged is imported, suitable devices should be used to measure the inflow into the\nstructure. The accounting of a system that has both surface and sub-surface recharge\nstructures should also include devices to measure precipitation and\nevapotranspiration, which should be added to the inflow and outflow respectively.\nInitial measurements should be of sufficient frequency to determine how each of the\nparameters being measured varies with time. Once the variation is determined, a\nschedule that provides accuracy and economy can be set, which should integrate all\nthe data being measured for optimizing data collection costs.\nThe data that should be measured for a recharge system include but are not limited to\nthe following:\n¾ Flow rate, duration and quality of source water.\n¾ Inflow and outflow rates, duration and quality of inflow and outflow into and\nout of each unit of the recharge system.\n¾ Recharge rates versus time for each unit and for the system as a whole.\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 172\n¾ Depth to water and quality of ground water in the area being recharged and\nadjacent areas.\n¾ Power usage by individual units and for the system as a whole.\n¾ Depth to water in the recharge structures versus time ( in case of surface\nstructures)\n¾ Thickness and composition of surface clogging layer when the structure is dry\n(in case of surface structures).\n¾ Pressure versus time ( in case of pressure injection)\n¾ Depth to water in recharge well versus time in case of gravity head recharge\nwells.\n¾ Precipitation and evaporation from surface ponds.\n¾ Temperature of water at inflow and outflow locations.\n¾ Time, rate and volume of p",
    "charge well versus time in case of gravity head recharge\nwells.\n¾ Precipitation and evaporation from surface ponds.\n¾ Temperature of water at inflow and outflow locations.\n¾ Time, rate and volume of pumping for each structure and for the system as a\nwhole.\nThe data mentioned above helps fine-tune the recharge facility and provides the basis\nfor corrections in case of problems. Periodic tests of pump efficiency, sampling of\nwater quality and ground water level measurements should also be made and recorded\non a defined schedule.\nMeasurement of any flows that pass downstream of the last recharge structure is\nneeded if the total recharge from the operation is to be assessed. The volume of water\npassing the downstream gauging station, adjusted for precipitation and evaporation\ncan be subtracted from the measured inflow volume to determine the quantum of\nwater recharged.\n10.1.1 Water Level Measurement\nMeasurement of ground water level in the aquifer, also known as ‘static water level’\nor ‘potentiometric head’ is very important in artificial recharge schemes. Water levels\nhave to be measured after a sufficient time has elapsed since stoppage of pumping or\nrecharge to allow the water level to become stabilized and the drawdown/mounding\neffects to be minimized. Measurement  of water levels in wells adjacent to a surface\nor subsurface recharge structure are also important as they help determine the shape\nand rate of growth of the recharge mound.\n10.1.2 Water Quality Measurement\nComplete water quality sampling and testing of a recharge scheme including source\nand aquifer should be done initially to determine the suitability of water for the\nintended use. The testing will provide a basis for the design of any other water quality\ntreatment facilities that may be needed. After implementation of the scheme, periodic\nwater quality assessment should be made. Proper training should be imparted to the\npersonnel involved to ensure that the samples are not contaminated during collection",
    "entation of the scheme, periodic\nwater quality assessment should be made. Proper training should be imparted to the\npersonnel involved to ensure that the samples are not contaminated during collection\nand transportation.\n10.2 Preventive Maintenance\nPreventive maintenance of artificial recharge structures implies a periodic action\ntaken to forestall major repair or replacement of its components. It may be drying up\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 173\nand scarifying of recharge ponds, periodic pumping of recharge wells, or regular\napplication of lubricants / protective substances to the mechanical parts or\nreplacement of minor parts that are subject to deterioration or repeated failure. It also\ninvolves regular observation and recording of the behaviour of both static and\ndynamic components of the system to detect changes in their inherent condition that\nindicates the need for unscheduled maintenance. These include reduction in the\nrecharge rates, temperature of mechanical parts or rate of settlement.\n10.2.1 Maintenance of  Surface Recharge Structures\nArtificial recharge structures such as percolation ponds and check dams are examples\nof ‘wet/dry cycle’ operation (ASTE, 2001) in which the structures get filled up one or\nmore times during monsoon and remain dry during the summer season. These\nstructures can be maintained by removing the silt deposited at the bottom of the\nstructure periodically. The optimal amount of cleaning would remove the\naccumulation of surface material that has reduced the recharge capacity of the\nstructure.\n10.3 Potential Problems\nThe Problems normally encountered in recharge projects are mainly related to the\nsource water available for recharge, which generally require some sort of treatment\nbefore use in recharge installations. They are also related to the changes in the soil\nstructure and the biological phenomena, which take place when infiltration begins, to\nthe changes of land ownership and legal aspe",
    "harge installations. They are also related to the changes in the soil\nstructure and the biological phenomena, which take place when infiltration begins, to\nthe changes of land ownership and legal aspects.\n10.3.1 Suspended Material\nA major requirement for waters that are to be used in recharge projects is that they\nshould be silt-free. Silt may be defined as the content of un-dissolved solid matter,\nusually measured in mg/l, which settles in stagnant water having velocities not\nexceeding 0.1 m/hr.  This definition comprises a large variety of materials such as\nclay particles, organic matter and fine particles of calcite. The silt content of river\nwater depends upon the type of soils in the area of run-off, the vegetative cover of this\narea, its topographic slopes, meteorological characteristics prevailing in its catchment\nand intensity of rainfall.\nSuspended matter may clog the soil in two different ways. Near the surface, the\ni n ters ti ces of th e s oi l m ay b e fi ll ed up an d a l ay er of m ud m ay b e deposi ted on th e\nsurface. On the other hand, they may penetrate deeper into the soil and accumulate\nth e r e . A l ay e r of m u d i s f orm e d on th e s u rf a ce b y pa r ti cl es , th e s e ttl i n g v el oci ty of\nwhich exceed infiltration velocities. Smaller suspended particles are filtered out in the\nuppermost layer of the soil. The filtration process is governed not only my mechanical\nfactors, but it seems to be strongly influenced by electro-chemical surface forces.\nStill finer particles, especially very fine grains of montmorillonite clay, are carried\nfurther into the soil. Observations in spreading grounds composed of medium-grained\ndune sands, showed that these particles become lodged at depths ranging from 10 to\n20 m b el ow th e s urf ace, an d s om e of th ese parti cl es are carri ed ev en deeper. Sem i -\npervious layers situated deep below the sand filter out even those particles and\nbecome progressively clogged.\nOperation and Maintenance\nManu",
    "e of th ese parti cl es are carri ed ev en deeper. Sem i -\npervious layers situated deep below the sand filter out even those particles and\nbecome progressively clogged.\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 174\nMethods to prevent or minimize the clogging effect by suspended matter can be\nclassified into the following broad groups:\n(a) Periodical removing of the mud cake and scraping of the surface layer\n(b) Installation of a filter on the surface, the permeability of which is lower\nthan that of the natural strata (the filter must be removed and replaced\nperiodically)\n(c) Addition of organic matter or chemicals to the uppermost layer\n(d) Cultivation of certain plant-covers, notably certain kinds of grass\nScraping of the surface layer is effective only in coarse-grained soils. In soils\ncomposed mainly of sand, repeated compaction by heavy machinery may easily\nnullify any benefit gained from scraping. Various chemicals and organic matter have\nbeen used to restore infiltration capacities.

The growth of a permanent grass-cover has proved to be an effective\nmethod for maintaining infiltration capacities, but it is difficult to select a grass which\ngrows under a given climatic and soil condition and is able to withstand alternate\nperiods of flooding and drying.\nClogging by biological activity depends upon the mineralogical and organic\ncomposition of the water and basin floor and upon the grain-size and permeability of\nthe soil. The only feasible method of treatment developed so far consists in\nthoroughly drying the ground under the basin.  Experiences seem to indicate that short\nperiods of operation (about one month), followed by drying, are more effective than\nprolonged periods of operation, even if they are followed by a prolonged and most\nthorough period of drying during the hot summ",
    "operation (about one month), followed by drying, are more effective than\nprolonged periods of operation, even if they are followed by a prolonged and most\nthorough period of drying during the hot summer.\nClogging and consequent destruction of bore holes may occur as a result of erosion of\nthe aquifer.  If velocities of flow are too high, fine sand and particles from local clay\nlayers may be dragged outward into the aquifer and clog it or even cause collapse of\nthe well.  The common-sense precautions against these mishaps in semi-consolidated\naquifers are to keep injection rates somewhat below the rate of proved safe continuous\npumping and to avoid frequent sudden changes of the injection rate, which may cause\nvibrations.  Experience has shown that no deterioration of the aquifer occurs if these\nreasonable precautions are taken.\nAir bubbles, which are sucked into the well through the injection pipe, cause violent\nvibrations when they finally escape upwards. The possibility of air seepage must\ntherefore be completely eliminated.  The only certain way to achieve this is to design\nand operate the installation so that positive pressures (exceeding atmospheric\npressure) are maintained everywhere in the injection pipe, even if this entails a\nreduction of injection rates.\nBore holes are much more prone to silting than spreading grounds.  No acceptable\nstandard of turbidity can be given. Clarity of the Water should conform to the\nstandards of good drinking water.  Clogging of the bore hole wall by bacterial growth\nmay occur, even if water of potable standard is injected. Even when chlorination at\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 175\nthe well-head carried out, the wells may still require periodic re-development by\nmechanical means and pumping.\n10.3.2 Environmental Problems\nA number of environmental problems may stem from artificial recharge schemes.\nSuch projects usually have to be carried out in the vicinity of densely populated and\nind",
    "g.\n10.3.2 Environmental Problems\nA number of environmental problems may stem from artificial recharge schemes.\nSuch projects usually have to be carried out in the vicinity of densely populated and\nindustrial areas, where large quantities of water are needed.  The close vicinity of\nspreading-grounds to population centers often creates various kinds of problems.  In\np a r t i c u l a r , i t i s w e l l k n o w n t h a t s t a g n a n t w a t e r s e r v e s a s a b r e e d i n g g r o u n d f o r\nmosquitoes, flies and a variety of other biological nuisances. The best remedy is to\noperate parts of spreading-grounds in sequence, so that water remains in each part for\na shorter period than the larvae stage of the insect's life-cycle.  This remedy may,\nhowever, lead to unrealistically large land requirements.\nOther types of damages can also be generated by such projects.  Artificial recharge is\na procedure designed to raise ground water levels, which, under certain\ncircumstances, can cause substantial damage such as inundation of basement of\nbuildings. Damages may also be claimed if the recharged water is of interior quality\nto that previously enjoyed by nearby well-owners.  Such might be the case where\nsaline water, originating from treated sewerage effluent, is recharged into a freshwater\naquifer.  In such instances, more water is made available, say, for irrigation, but the\npractice may simultaneously create a deterioration of water used for drinking\npurposes.\nThere is no general solution for such problems. Each case has to be studied\nindependently, taking into account the physical, economic, human and legal aspects.\nThere is no doubt, however, that in most cases the overall benefits of such projects in\nwater-short areas largely transcend the drawbacks.\n10.3.3 Water Quality Problems\nVarious chemical processes such as adsorption, ion-exchange, oxidation and\ndissolution are expected to occur during the process of artificial recharge.

    "ty Problems\nVarious chemical processes such as adsorption, ion-exchange, oxidation and\ndissolution are expected to occur during the process of artificial recharge. Adsorption\nprocesses can occur at several levels from precipitated flocs to individual ion\nadsorption. Iron oxyhydroxide and organic flocs are particularly sticky substances and\nusually get adsorbed on aquifer particles and reduce the amount of water that can\nmove through the aquifer. Acidification can be attempted to recover some\npermeability.\nIon-Exchange is significant if the aquifer water is brackish to saline.  The clay\nparticles typically have Sodium in exchange positions and these sodium ions are\nstable in high TDS conditions.  Artificial recharge results in a reduction in TDS due to\ninjection of lower TDS water and this increase reaction between dissolved ions in\nground water. Calcium will replace the sodium in the exchange position, converting\nthe clay to calcium rich clay.  This exchange destabilizes the attached clay particles\nand allows them to move into the pore spaces of the aquifer, causing plugging.\nMost aquifers are under either moderately oxidizing or reducing environments.\nArtificial recharge process with recharge water of more oxidizing nature than the\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 176\nground water will destabilize the equilibrium of native ground water oxidation\nreduction conditions and cause chemical reactions to occur.  Siderite (Iron\nCarbonate), Pyrite and Marcasite are the most susceptible to oxidation by recharge\nwater.  Depending upon how much of these minerals are present in the aquifer, the\nplugging of pores by iron oxyhydroxide flocs takes place.  This plays a major role in\nareas where the pollutants get release and mobilized in an aquifer.\nSolubility is a complex process that can involve several phases.

Carbon-dioxide\nparticipates in macrobiotic reactions and depending on PH, carbonic acid, bicarbonate\nand carbonate form in sequence with increasing pH.  Finally, with sufficiently high\ncalcium and carbonate concentrations, Calcite precipitates.\n10.4  Physical, Biological and Chemical Compatibility of Water\nArtificial recharge through injection wells can be effectively achieved if the recharge\nwater i s ch emi cally an d phy si cally com pati bl e with th e n ati v e groun d water.  If th e\nrecharge water has similar chemical and physical characteristics, it will mix with the\nground water without producing any undesirable effect in the aquifer media.  It is\nimpractical to determine whether the two waters are compatible by using only the few\nknown factors and also it will be difficult to monitor the physicochemical\nenvironment in the aquifer system which is subjected to stress and strain through\nartificial recharge.\n10.4.1 Physical Compatibility\ni) Temperature\nTwo physical properties that relate to the compatibility of the recharge water and\nnative ground water are viscosity and density. Viscosity and density are inversely\nproportional to temperature.  If the injected water is colder than the native ground\nwater, the injected water tends to settle towards the bottom owing to its greater\ndensity and viscosity.  Cold water has greater viscosity and therefore moves through\nthe interstices of an aquifer less freely than warm water. Thus, if the temperature of\nwater in an aquifer is reduced, the effective permeability of the aquifer also gets\nreduced.\nii) Suspended Material\nThe presence of small amounts of suspended material in recharge water will seriously\naffect the performance of an injection well and the aquifer materials adjacent to the\nwell.  The degree of clogging depends not only upon the amount of sediment but also\nup",
    "charge water will seriously\naffect the performance of an injection well and the aquifer materials adjacent to the\nwell.  The degree of clogging depends not only upon the amount of sediment but also\nupon the composition of the sediment, the size of the particles, the composition of the\naquifer materials and interstitial space in the aquifer.  The effect of clogging in an\ninjection well can be recognized by observing the injection rate and water level in the\ni n j e c t i o n w e l l .

Depending upon the\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 177\nturbidity level of surface water, two-stage filtration can be adopted if required with a\nrapid filtration stage followed with slow filtration. It is necessary to monitor the\nturbidity of recharge water periodically.  During the recharge process, if the records of\nwater level and injection rate indicate clogging, it is necessary to surge (back flush)\nthe injection well with heavy discharge pumps for a short duration.  Surging helps in\nthe removal of silt settled in the well section and in the aquifer zones adjacent to the\nwell.  If the recharge process is continued without surging, the suspended particles\nmay enter into the interior part of the aquifer and it would be difficult to remove the\nparticles settled in the interstices.  It is advisable to do the surging periodically,\nirrespective of any indications of clogging.\niii) Air\nAir introduced into a well during recharge may affect the permeability of the aquifer\nthrough both physical and chemical processes.

    "rge may affect the permeability of the aquifer\nthrough both physical and chemical processes. The air bubbles occupy the space in\nthe interstices, thereby reducing the effective porosity and block the movement of\nwater. The bubbles are normally tightly held on to the aquifer materials by molecular\nattraction and get diffused very slowly.  In fresh water used for injection, the ratio of\ndissolved oxygen, nitrogen and other atmospheric gases is virtually constant at normal\nwater temperature, unless the oxygen content is reduced or increased by biological\nactivity.  Clogging by air bubbles is easily recognized by a sharp increase in injection\nwell water level immediately after recharge operations start. The air clogging is easily\nseen by formation of air foaming when the injection operation is stopped.  Physical\nentrapment of air in the recharge well can be minimized by carrying the injection pipe\nsome distance below the static water level in the well. Surging operations may help in\nremoving some air clogging near the well screen.\n10.4.2 Biological Compatibility\nB i o l o g i c a l s u i t a b i l i t y o f t h e r e c h a r g e w a t e r i s a l s o a n i m p o r t a n t f a c t o r c o n t r o l l i n g\neffective artificial recharge.  Pathogenic bacteria can render a ground water unfit as a\nsource of drinking water. Other harmless bacteria species may lead to coloring of\nground water and cause unpleasant taste and odour. Bacteria in a suspended matter\nmultiply rapidly when their food supply is abundant. When they enter the recharge\nwell along with recharge water and multiply in the well screen openings or in the\ngravel pack, resulting in clogging or reduction in intake rate. In the case of\nbacteriological clogging, the rise in injection head reaches its maximum value after\nsome days only.

Pre-treatment\nthrough slow sand filtration of injected water and chlorination may prevent the growth\nof bacteria in an injection well. Maintaining a residual chlorine level of 1-2 mg/l in\nthe injection well is recommended for minimising the biological clogging.\n10.4.3 Chemical Compatibility\nBore hole injection operations encounter difficulties when the recharge water reacts\nwith the native ground water or with the aquifer material.  The reaction may lead to\nformation of insoluble deposits in the pore spaces, hindering the ground water\nmovement.  Three reaction stages over time and space may be distinguished:\nOperation and Maintenance\nManual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water 178\ni) At the very beginning of the recharge process, the native ground water i s\nd i s p l a c e d b y t h e r e c h a r g e w a t e r .

Formation of mixed zone cannot be prevented,\nbut it is possible to prevent the formation of a mixed zone in the near\nv i ci ni ty of th e w el l b y i nj e c ti n g a n am oun t of n on - r e a c ti v e w a te r , w h i ch\neffects deposition at a distance sufficiently away from the well so that the\nintake capacity of the well is not affected.\nii) With passage of time, all the native ground water in the aquifer is replaced\nby recharge water.

The limitation of available surface water resources has put an onus on \ngroundwater to meet the requirement. The groundwater development has gone up manifolds \nto cater to the demand from agriculture, industry and domestic activities. The availability of \ngroundwater is always expressed either in relation to its availability or to the annual \nreplenishment, for management purposes. Thus, the term safe yield or sustaina ble yield is \ngenerally used by many developed countries for sustainable development of groundwater. In \nIndia, the replenishable groundwater resources are assessed periodically (every three years) \nand areas are categorized on the basis of Stage of groundwater extraction (safe yield).  \n \nThe water stress is being felt at different parts of the country owing to the increasing demand \nresulting from the population explosion. In order to meet the demand, the share of groundwater \nhas increased exponentially, it has  far exceeded the natural recharge in many parts of the \ncountry, necessitating the both central and State government to take up water conservation \nthrough many schemes.

    "e revised master plan will provide general guidance for terrain \nspecific structures c onsidering the availability of surplus source water and indicate a rough \nball park figure for culminating such efforts. \n \nMaster Plan for artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India was prepared by CGWB in the year \n2013, which was the revision of the concep tual plan made in 2002.  In view of the active \nparticipation of central and State agencies in water conservation, a need was felt to revise the \nmaster plan prepared in 2013. Accordingly, an inter departmental committee was constituted \nby the Ministry to revise the master plan and the document is the resultant of the efforts of the \ncommittee through the Regional offices of CGWB. \n \nThe revised master plan for artificial recharge to groundwater has been made for the whole \ncountry at the level of district/Block.  The plan is macro plan formulated to work out the \nfeasibility of various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country and respective \nestimated cost. Hence, the revision of the master plan is like any other master plan prepared \nfor a State or city, which brings out the broad outline of the project and expected investments \nand for implementation, DPR has to be prepared at an implementable level like any other \nwater supply project or city development project. \n \nThe area for artificial recharge has been identified based on post monsoon water level (2018) \nand long-term post monsoon water trend in most of the States & UTs. However, due to paucity \nof data and local groundwater issues, additional/different criteria were used in different \nStates/UTs. In the case of NE States, UT of Jammu & Kashmir & UT of Ladakh, the criteria of \nwater scarcity have been used and structures have been suggested to harness the run off \ngenerated from the rain. In case of UT of Lakshadweep & UT of Daman & Diu, due to shallow \ngroundwater level, only RTRWH has been suggested. An area of 11.23 Lakh sq.km has been \nide",

An area of 11.23 Lakh sq.km has been \nidentified for artificial recharge.  \n \nThe scope of artificial recharge depends on the available sub surface space for recharge, \nwater required for recharge and surpl us water available for recharge.  The volume of space \navailable up to 3m bgl or 5m bgl depending on the criteria adopted in different States multiplied \nby the specific yield of the aquifers will provide the space available for recharge. Considering \nan efficiency of 60% or 75% as deemed fit in different States, the water required for artificial \nrecharge has been worked out for each State. The surplus available for recharge after \ndeducting the committed supply has been estimated for each State. The available sub-surface \nspace for artificial recharge 537.349 BCM, while the water required to saturate the aquifer up \nto 3 to 5m bgl is 716.917 BCM. The surplus source water available for recharge is of the order \nof 185.092 BCM. The availability of source water for r echarge is not uniform and in many \ndistricts in the States of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat etc., the source water available \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n \n \n \nis less than the requirement and artificial recharge structures are restricted to the source water \navailability.  \n \nThe types of structures are decided by the terrain conditions and the number of structures are \ndecided by the source water availability. The different type of structures suitable for different \nterrain conditions and the use of different terminology for the similar s tructures in various \nStates have resulted in more than 25 types of structures.

    "ed in more than 25 types of structures. In order to group different structures \nand bring in standardization, the structures were studied and grouped in to 10 groups and in \nthe group “Others” all the uncommon structure s are classified. About 75% of structures are \ntowards RTRWH, while 17% is for “Others”, with 3% for RS, 2% of structures are in the \ncategory of CD & Gabion structures and 1% under PT category. The unit cost of structure also \nis found varying within the Sta tes for different districts for some States, while in some \nStates/UTs they have assumed a uni form rate. RTRWH accounts for 2 8% of cost, while \n“others” category is for 23% of cost and CD & PT account for 19% & RS for 07% of cost. The \ntotal cost for implementation of this revised master plan is Rs 133529.69 Cr, with Rs 96735.45 \nCr (72%) for rural areas and Rs 36794.23 Cr (28%) for Urban areas. \n \nThe implementation approach of artificial recharge projects shall depend on various factors \nand hence cannot be uniform for the entire country. The major factors in this regard are hydro-\ngeomorphological settings of different areas which vary in different terrain conditions. The \nwatershed approach can be considered to best fit for hard rock terrains, while the basin/sub \nbasin approach is practically suitable for alluvial/sedimentary terrain  having large & thick \naquifers. Similarly, in hilly terrains, springshed approach can be more scientific & useful in \nimplementation while taking up spring rejuvenation projects. Depend ing upon the type of \nexisting terrain conditions, the plan  for artificial recharge need to be conceptualised by  \nStates/UTs while collecting various information/data. \n \nThere are many existing schemes and a new scheme is under preparation in respect of \ncomprehensive measures for water conservation in select water stressed districts in the \ncountry, resulted out of Budget announcement of the Government, which can cater to the \nimplementation of the revised master plan.

    "for water conservation in select water stressed districts in the \ncountry, resulted out of Budget announcement of the Government, which can cater to the \nimplementation of the revised master plan. No separate funding is required for executi ng the \nrevised master plan. The different scheme can take the cue from the master plan and construct \nthese structures as per the norms of the schemes. The execution of these structure may take \na period of 10 years, if the existing schemes dovetail their activities for convergence towards \nwater conservation. \n \nOwing to the over dependence on groundwater, both State & Central Government Agencies \nare dovetailing their activities towards water conservation. Consequently, construction of the \nartificial recharge s tructures has increased over the years. Further, the construction of \nstructures also depends on the surplus water availability and hence it becomes imperative that \ngeotagging of these structures is made and their functional status monitored. Hence, one \nNodal agency is to be identified for each State/UT by the respective States /UTs, which will \nfunction as a focal point for the water conservation database and documentations.  \n \nThe master plan for artificial recharge to groundwater has been revised considerin g the \nexisting data availability. Considering the technological advancement and parallel scientific \nstudies of NAQUIM being taken up in the country, it is proposed to carry out next revision on \na larger scale of 1: 10,000. With the large scale thematic map s, it would be feasible to have \nmicro-level information on area -specific feasible recharge structures  & their location, which \ncan be refined during preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs)  by the implementing \nagency in the state.

The limitation of available surface water resources has put an onus on \ngroundwater to meet the requirement. The groundwater development has gone up manifolds \nto cater to the demand from agriculture, industry and domestic requirements.

    "riculture, industry and domestic requirements. The availability \nof groundwater is a lways expressed either in relation to its availability or to the annual \nreplenishment. Thus the term safe yield or sustainable yield is generally used by many \ndeveloped countries for sustainable development of groundwater. In India, the replenishable \ngroundwater resources are assessed periodically (every three years) and areas are \ncategorized on the basis of Stage of groundwater extraction (safe yield).  \nGroundwater Resources Assessment are jointly carried out by CGWB & respective State \nAgencies using Groundwater Estimation Committee methodology, as a standard method to \nassess the groundwater resources. The latest assessment of dynamic groundwater resources \nis GWRA-2017, using GEC-2015 methodology. In the assessment, the total annual ground \nwater recharge has been estimated as 432bcm. Keeping an allocation for natural discharge, \nthe annual extractable ground water resource is 393bcm. The total current annual ground \nwater extraction (as in March, 2017) is 249bcm. The average stage of ground water extraction \nfor the country as a whole works out to be about 63 %. The extraction of ground water for \nvarious uses in different parts of the country is not uniform. Out of the total 6881 assessment \nunits (Blocks/ Mandals/ Talukas/Firkas) in the country,1186 units in various States (17% )have \nbeen categorized as ‘Over-Exploited’ indicating ground water extraction exceeding the \nannually replenishable ground water recharge. In these areas the percentage of groundwater \nextraction is morethan100percent. In addition, 313units (5%) are ‘Critical’, where the stage of \nground water extraction is between 90-100 %. There are 972 semi-critical units (14%), where \nthe stage of ground water extraction is between 70% and 90%  and 4310 assessment units \n(63%) have been categorized as ‘Safe‘, where the stage of Ground water extraction is less \nthan 70 %. Apart from this, there are 100 assessm",
    "traction is between 70% and 90%  and 4310 assessment units \n(63%) have been categorized as ‘Safe‘, where the stage of Ground water extraction is less \nthan 70 %. Apart from this, there are 100 assessment units (1%), which have been \ncategorized, as ‘Saline’ as major part of the ground water in phreatic aquifers is brackish or \nsaline. In respect of West Bengal, the results of GWRA-2017 indicated a huge variation with \nrespect of previous assessment of resources and the reasons for the changes in West Bengal \nwas not found reasonable and adequate and further, SLC has also not approved the GWRA- \n2017 assessmen t. Hence, CLEG recommended that the results of 2013 assessment in \nrespect of West Bengal may be used in place of GWRA -2017 assessment for national \ncompilation of GWRA-2017 with a rider that after approval of GWRA - 2017 by SLC of West \nBengal, a corrigendum may be issued separately, incorporating the results of GWRA-2017. \nAccordingly, the results of 2013 assessment have been considered for West Bengal. The \ncategorization map of India (GWRA-2017) is given as Fig 1.1. \n \nIn order to tackle the twin hazards of de -saturation of aquifer zones and consequent \ndeterioration of ground water quality, there is an urgent need to augment the ground water \nresources through suitable management interventions. Artificial recharge has now been \naccepted world-wide as a cost-effective method to augment ground water resources in areas \nwhere continued overexploitation without due regard to their recharging options has resulted \nin various undesirable environmental consequences. \n \nAny executable plan requires the planning to be made in macro level at the first instance and \nthereafter taken to micro level at the time of execution.   Master Plan for artificial Recharge to \nGroundwater in India was prepared by CGWB in the year 2013, which was the revision of the \nconceptual plan made in 2002.

    "ndwater in India was prepared by CGWB in the year 2013, which was the revision of the \nconceptual plan made in 2002.  In view of the fact active participation of central and State \nagencies in water conservation efforts, a need was felt to revise the master plan prepared in \n2013.  \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nFig 1.1 Categorization Map of India (GWRA-2017) \n \n1.2 Salient Features of Master Plan (2013) \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n3 \n \n \nThe preparation of master plan for artificial recharge to ground water in different states, \nprepared by Central Ground Water Board in 2013, aims at providing terrain specific artificial \nrecharge techniques to augment the ground water reservoir based on  the twin important \nrequirements of source water availability and capability of ground water reservoir to \naccommodate it. The specific problems in different areas in the states like excessive ground \nwater development resulting in ground water decline, wate r scarcity due to inadequate \nrecharge in arid areas, low ground water retention in hilly areas despite substantial rainfall, \nurban areas with limited ground water recharge avenues and related problems of urban \npollution, etc., have been considered while pr eparing the master plan. To fully utilize the \navailable surplus monsoon runoff in rural areas, emphasis has been given for adoption of \nartificial recharge techniques based on surface spreading like percolation tanks, nala bunds, \netc., and sub -surface techniques of recharge shaft, well recharge, etc. In urban areas, hilly \nareas and coastal regions priority has to be given to rain water conservation measures through \nroof top harvesting techniques etc. \nThe Master Plan while bringing out the areas suitable for artificial recharge to ground water \nreservoir, prioritizes the areas wherein schemes need to be implemented as a first priori",
    "echniques etc. \nThe Master Plan while bringing out the areas suitable for artificial recharge to ground water \nreservoir, prioritizes the areas wherein schemes need to be implemented as a first priority to \nameliorate the water scarcity problems. The proposals and schemes recommended are not \nthe ultimate ones but are the first stage of implementation. These need to be further extended \nin other areas depending on the availability of infrastructure, finances and future problems. \nThe master plan envisaged the number of artificial recharge and water conservation \nstructures in the country as 110lakh at an estimated cost of Rs.79178 crores. \n1.3 Efforts of Water Conservation by the Government \n (http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf) \nHon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the \nimportance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all \nappropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.  \nCreation of a new Ministry of Jal Shakti for dealing with all matters relating to water at one \nplace in an integrated manner.  \nThe National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water \nResources, RD & GR, inter -alia, advoc ates rain water harvesting and conservation of \nwater and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use \nof rainfall. It also, inter-alia, advocates conservation of river, river bodies and infrastructure \nshould be undertaken in a scientifically planned manner through community participation. \nFurther, encroachment and diversion of water bodies and drainage channels must not be \nallowed and wherever, it has taken place, it should be restored to the extent feasible and \nmaintained properly.  \nIn compliance to the decision taken by the Committee of Secretaries, an ‘Inter-Ministerial \nCommittee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary(WR, RD & GR) has been constituted to \ntake forward the subj",

So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented \nthe ground water legislation on the lines of Model bill.  \nCentral Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has issued directions under Section 5 of “The \nEnvironment Protection Act, 1986” for mandatory Rain Water Harvesting / Roof Top Rain \nWater Harvesting for all target areas in the Country including UTs. While granting ‘No \nObjection Certificate (NOC)’ for drawing ground water, CGWA insists for mandatory rain \nwater harvesting as per the guidelines issued.  \nCentral Ground Water Board (CGWB) under DoWR, RD & GR has also prepared a \nconceptual document entitled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in \nIndia” during the year 2013, which envisages construction of 1.11 crore rain water \nharvesting and artif icial recharge structures in the Country at an estimated cost of Rs. \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n4 \n \n \n79,178 crores to harness 85 BCM (Billion Cubic Metre) of water, in an area of 9,41,541 \nsq.km by harnessing surplus monsoon runoff to augment ground water resources.  \n Besides, CGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management programme during XII \nPlan, under the scheme of Ground Water Management and Regulation.

The major activities taken up under the WDC -PMKSY, inter-alia, \ninclude ridge area treatment, drainage line affo restation, soil and moisture conservation, \nrain water harvesting, horticulture, and pasture development etc.  \nMinistry of Housing & Urban Affairs has released Model Building Bye -laws, 2016 which \nrecommends Rainwater Harvesting for all types of Building with plot size 100 sq.m or more. \nBarring the States/UT of Sikkim, Mizoram and Lakshadweep, all the States have \nincorporated the provisions in their respective building bye laws. The plans submitted to \nthe local bodies shall indicate the system of storm water drainage along with points of \ncollection of rain water in surface reservoirs or in recharge wells. Further, all building \nhaving a minimum discharge of 10,000 litre and above per day shall incorporate waste \nwater recycling system. The recycled water should be used for horticultural purposes.  \nGovernment of India has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6000 Crore Central \nSector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community \nparticipation in water stressed blocks of Gujar at, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. \n1.4 Past Initiatives of CGWB \nExperiments on artificial recharge to aquifers started in India from1970 onwards by Central \nand State Government Departments and individually by some NGOs in different parts of the \ncountry where early signs of overexploitation of ground water were noticed.

Physiography varies \nwidely from rugged mountainous terrains of Himalayas, Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats and \nDeccan Plateau to the flat alluvial plains of the river valleys and coastal tracts, and the Aeolian \ndeserts in western part.  Similarly rainfall pattern also shows region wise variations. \nVarious rock types occurring in the country have been categorized as follows to describe the \nground water characteristics.  \n1. Porous rock formation \n(a) Unconsolidated formations. \n(b) Semi-consolidated formations \n2. Hard rock/ consolidated formations \nThe proper understanding of the characteristics of rock types help in site selection and \ndesigning artificial recharge structures. The area recording high yield is obviously having more \nstorage potential and hence there is scope for more recharge to ground water.  \n2.1.1 Porous Rock Formations \n2.1.1.1Unconsolidated Formations \nThe sediments comprising newer alluvium, ol der alluvium and coastal alluvium are by and \nlarge the important repositories of ground water.  These are essentially composed of clay, \nsand, gravel and boulders, ferruginous nodules, kankar (calcareous concretions), etc.  The \nbeds of sand and gravel and t heir admixtures form potential aquifers.  The aquifer materials \nvary in particle size, roundness and sorting. Consequently, their water yielding capabilities \nalso vary considerably.  The coastal aquifers show wide variations in the water quality both \nlaterally and vertically. \nThe piedmont zone of the Himalayas extending from Jammu and Kashmir in the west to \nTripura in the east, offers suitable locations for artificial recharge.  The hydrogeological \nconditions and ground water regime in Indo -Ganga-Brahmaputra basin indicate existence of \nlarge quantities of fresh ground water down to 600 m or more below land surface.

    "of \nlarge quantities of fresh ground water down to 600 m or more below land surface. Bestowed \nwith high rainfall and good recharge conditions, the ground water gets replenished every year \nin these zones.  The alluvial aquifers to the explored depth of 600 m have transmissivity values \nfrom 250 to 4000 m2/day and hydraulic conductivity from 10 to 800 m/day.   \n2.1.1.2 Semi-consolidated Formations \nThe semi-consolidated formations mainly comprise shales, sandstones and limestones.  The \nsedimentary deposits belonging to Gondwana and Tertiary formations are included under this \ncategory.  The sandstones form highly potential aquifers locally, particularly in Peninsular \nIndia.  Elsewhere they have only moderate potential and at places they yield meagre supplies.  \nThese sediments normally occur at narrow valleys or structurally faulted basins.  Though these \nformations have been identified to possess moderate potential, the physiography of the terrain \nnormally restricts development.  Under favo rable situations, these sediments give rise to \nartesian conditions as in parts of GodavariValley, Cambay basin and parts of West Coast, \nPuducherry and Neyveli in Tamil Nadu.  Potential aquifers particularly those belonging to \nGondwanas and Tertiaries have Transmissivity values from 100 to 2300 m 2/day and the \nhydraulic conductivity from 0.5 to 70 m/day.  Generally, the well yields in productive areas \nrange from 10 to 50 lps.  Lathi and Nagaur sandstone in Rajasthan and Tipam sandstone in \nTripura state also form productive aquifers. \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n8 \n \n \n2.1.2 Hard Rock Formation \n2.1.2.1Consolidated Formations \nThe consolidated formations occupy almost two thirds of the country.  From the \nhydrogeological point of view, the consolidated rocks are broadly classified into the followi ng \nthree types: \na) Igneous and metamorphic rocks excluding volcanic and carbonate rocks \nb) Volcanic rocks",
    "ogeological point of view, the consolidated rocks are broadly classified into the followi ng \nthree types: \na) Igneous and metamorphic rocks excluding volcanic and carbonate rocks \nb) Volcanic rocks \nc) Carbonate rocks \nThese formations control the ground water availability and scope for augmentation and \nartificial recharge. The nature, occurrence and movement of ground water in these formations \nare described as follows: \n2.1.2.2Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks \nThe most common rock types are granites, gneisses, charnockites, khondalites, quartzites, \nschist and associated phyllite, slate, etc.  These rocks do not possess primary porosity but are \nrendered porous and permeable due to secondary porosity created by fracturing and \nweathering. \nGround water yield and capability to accept recharge also depend on rock types.  Granite and \ngneiss are better repositories than Charnockites.  The ground water studies carried out in the \ncrystalline hard rocks reveal the existence of lineaments along deeply weathered and fractured \nzones, locally forming potential aquifers.  These lineament zones are found to be highly \nproductive for construction of bore wells. These in turn offer good scope for recharge through \nsuitable techniques. \nIn areas underlain by hard crystalline and meta -sedimentaries viz; granite, gneiss, schist, \nphyllite, quartzite, charnockites, etc., occurrence of ground  water in the fracture system has \nbeen identified even up to 300 m and beyond locally.  In most of the granite/ gneiss area, the \nweathered residuum serves as an effective ground water repository.  It has been observed \nthat the fracture systems are generally hydraulically connected with the overlying weathered \nsaturated residuum.  The yield potential of the crystalline and meta-sedimentary aquifers show \nwide variations.  Bore wells tapping the fracture systems generally yield from less than 1.0 lps \nto 10 lps.  The Transmissivity values vary from 10 to 500 m2/day and the hydraulic conduct",
    "ifers show \nwide variations.  Bore wells tapping the fracture systems generally yield from less than 1.0 lps \nto 10 lps.  The Transmissivity values vary from 10 to 500 m2/day and the hydraulic conductivity \nvalues vary from 0.1 to 10 m/day. \n2.1.2.3 Volcanic Rocks  \nThe basaltic lava flows are mostly horizontal to gently dipping.  Ground water occurrence in \nthese hard rocks i s controlled by the contrasting water bearing properties of different lava \nflows.  The topography, nature and extent of weathering, jointing and fracture pattern, \nthickness and depth of occurrence of vesicular basalts are the important factors which play a \nmajor role in the occurrence and movement of ground water in these rocks.  Basalts or Deccan \nTraps usually have medium to low permeability depending on the presence of primary and \nsecondary porosity.  Pumping tests have shown that under favourable conditions, bore wells \nyield about 3 to 6 lps at moderate drawdown.  Transmissivity and the hydraulic conductivity \nvalues of these aquifers are generally in the range of 25 to 100 m2/day and 0.05 to 15 m/day \nrespectively. \n2.1.2.4Carbonate Rocks \nCarbonate rocks in clude limestone, marble and dolomite.  Among the carbonate rocks, \nlimestones occur extensively.  In carbonate rocks, solution cavities lead to widely contrasting \npermeability within short distances.  Potential limestone aquifers are found to occur in \nRajasthan and Peninsular India in which the yields range from 5 to 25 lps.  Large springs exist \nin the Himalayan Region in the limestone formations.

Brackish ground water occurs \nin the arid zones of Rajasthan, close to coastal tracts in Saurashtra and Kutch, and in some \nzones in the east coast and certain parts of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, etc., \nwhich are under extensive surface water irrigation.  The fluoride levels in the ground water are \nconsiderably higher than the permissible limit in vast areas of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and \nRajasthan and in some parts of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, M.P., Karnataka and T amil Nadu.  In \nthe north-eastern regions, ground water with iron content above the desirable limit occurs \nwidely.  Pollution due to human and animal wastes and fertilizer application has resulted in \nhigh levels of nitrate and potassium in ground water in s ome parts of the country.  Ground \nwater contamination in pockets of industrial zones is observed in localized areas.  The over -\nexploitation of the coastal aquifers in the Saurashtra and Kutch regions of Gujarat has resulted \nin salinisation of coastal aquif ers due to sea water ingress. The excessive ground water \nwithdrawal near the city of Chennai has led to seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. The \nartificial recharge techniques can be utilized in improving the quality of ground water through \ndilution and to maintain the delicate fresh water-salt water interface in coastal zone.  \n2.3 Groundwater Resource Potential \nThe rock formations and their properties have",

The prolific aquifers are also potential for accepting greater recharge, provided \nsufficient space is available. The Hydrogeology map with the spatial variation of yield potential \nis given as Fig 2.1. The annual precipitation including snowfall in India is of the order of 3880 \nBCM and the total water availability is computed as 1999 BCM.  The utilizable surface water \nand replenishable ground water resources are of the order of 690 BCM and 43 2 BCM \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n11 \n \n \nrespectively.

Many other basins like Mahi, Tapi and \nPennar are already water stressed. \n \n \nFig. 2.2 Per Capita Water availability in India \n \n2.4  Groundwater Development Scenario \nDuring the past four decades, there has been a phenomenal increase in the growth of ground \nwater abstraction structures due to implementation of technically viable scheme s for \ndevelopment of the resource, backed by liberal funding from institutional finance agencies, \nimprovement in availability of electric power and diesel, good quality seeds, fertilizers, \ngovernment subsidies, etc.  During the period 1951 -2014, the number of dug wells increased \nfrom 3.86 million to 8.78 million that of shallow tube wells from 3000 to 5.94 million and deep \ntube wells from negligible to 5.8 million.  There has been a steady increase in the area irrigated \nfrom ground water from 6.5 Mha in 195 1 to 63.38Mha in 2014.  The groundwater extraction \nfor all uses as per GWRA-2017 is 248.69 B.Cu.m. \nSuch a magnitude of ground water development with sub optimal planning has resulted in \ncreating deleterious effects in terms of ground water depletion and quality deterioration. These \nmultiple challenges emerging in different parts of country need a suitable ground water \nmanagement approach.

Artificial recharge techniques normally address to the following issues:  \nTo enhance the sustainability in areas where over-development has depleted the aquifer. \nConservation and storage of excess surface water for future requirements, since these \nrequirements often change within a season or a period \nTo improve the quality of existing ground water through dilution. \n \n3.1 Groundwater Reservoirs \nThe rivers and rivulets of the Indian sub continent are mainly monsoon fed with 80 to 90 \npercent runoff generated during the monsoon.  The principle source for ground water recharge \nis also monsoon precipitation.  The country receives more than 75% monsoon rainfall from \nJune to September except in the eastern coast.  Annually the rainy days vary from 12 to 100, \nand actual rainfall time varies from a few hours to over 300 hours.  Incidences of up to 60 \npercent annual rainfall within a few days duration in a year are common in many parts of the \ncountry, causing excessive runoff, taking a heavy toll of life, agriculture and property.  \nHarnessing of excess monsoon runoff in ground water storage/reservoir will not only increase \nthe availability of water to meet the growing water demands, but also help in controlling \ndamages from floods. \nThe sub surface reservoirs are technically feasible alternatives for",
    "ot only increase \nthe availability of water to meet the growing water demands, but also help in controlling \ndamages from floods. \nThe sub surface reservoirs are technically feasible alternatives for storing surplus monsoon \nrunoff and store substantial quantity of water.  The sub surface geological formations may be \nconsidered as “warehouse” for storing water that come from sources located on the land \nsurface.  Besides suitable lithological condition, other considerations for creating sub surface \nstorages are favorable geological structures and physiographic units, whose dimensions and \nshape will allow retention of substantial volume of water in porous and permeable formations. \nThe sub surface reservoirs located in suitable hydrogeological situations will be environment  \nfriendly and economically viable for artificial recharge.  The sub surface storages have \nadvantages of being free from the adverse effects like inundation of large surface area, loss \nof cultivable land, displacement of local population, substantial evapor ation losses and \nsensitivity to earthquakes.  No gigantic structures are needed to store sub-surface water.  The \nunderground storage of water also has beneficial influence on the existing ground water \nregime and abstraction structures. The deeper water levels in many parts of the country either \nof natural occurrence or due to excessive ground water development, may be substantially \nraised, resulting in reduction on lifting costs and energy saving.  The quality of natural ground \nwater would substantially imp rove in brackish and saline areas.  The conduit function of \naquifers can further help in natural sub surface transfer of water to various needy centres, \nthereby reducing the cost intensive surface water conveyance system.  The effluence resulting \nfrom such sub surface storage of various surface intersection points in the form of spring line, \nor stream emergence, would enhance the river flows and improve the degraded eco -syste",
    "ence resulting \nfrom such sub surface storage of various surface intersection points in the form of spring line, \nor stream emergence, would enhance the river flows and improve the degraded eco -system \nof riverine tracts, particularly in the outfall areas. The structures required for arresting surface \nrunoff and recharging to ground water reservoirs are of small dimensions and cost effective \nsuch as check dams, percolation tanks, surface spreading basins, pits, sub -surface dykes, \netc. and these can be constructed with local knowhow. \n \n3.2 Basic Requirements \nThe basic requirements for recharging the ground water reservoir are: \nNeed for the artificial recharge, indicated by deeper water levels and declining water level \ntrends \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n14 \n \n \nScope for artificial recharge, indicated by the availability o f non -committed surplus \nmonsoon run off in space and time and the ability of system to accept the recharge \nBenefit cost ratio \nBased on the above criteria, suitable sites would be selected for taking up artificial recharge. \n3.2.1  Source water Availability \nThe availability of source water, one of the prime requisites for ground water recharge, is \nbasically assessed in terms of non-committed surplus monsoon run off, which as per present \nwater resource development scenario is going unutilized.  This component can be assessed \nby analyzing the monsoon rainfall pattern, its frequency, number of rainy days, and maximum \nrainfall in a day and its variation in space and time.  The committed water supply required for \nthe existing water bodies and downstream rights woul d define the uncommitted surplus, \nconsidering the variations in rainfall pattern in space and time. \n3.2.2  Hydrogeological Aspects \nDetailed knowledge of geological and hydrological features of the area is necessary for \nselecting the site and the type of re charge structure.

    "geological Aspects \nDetailed knowledge of geological and hydrological features of the area is necessary for \nselecting the site and the type of re charge structure.  In particular, the features, parameters \nand data to be considered are geological boundaries, hydraulic boundaries, inflow and outflow \nof waters, storage capacity, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, natural discharge \nof springs, water resources available for recharge, natural recharge, water balance, lithology, \ndepth of the aquifer, and tectonic boundaries.   \nThe evaluation of the storage potential of sub -surface reservoir is invariably based on the \nknowledge of dimensional data of reservoir rock, which includes their thickness and lateral \nextent.  The availability of sub -surface storage space and its replenishment capacity further \ngovern the extent of recharge.  The hydrogeological situation in each area needs to be \nappraised with a view to assess the recharge capabilities of the underlying hydrogeological \nformations.  The unsaturated thickness of rock formations, occurring beyond three meters \nbelow ground level should be considered to assess the requirement of water to build  up the \nsub-surface storage by saturating the entire thickness of the vadose zone to 3 meter below \nground level. The upper 3 m of the unsaturated zone is not considered for recharging, since it \nmay cause adverse environmental impact in terms of water loggi ng, soil salinity, etc.  The \nhistorical water level behaviour gives an idea of the maximum saturation existed in a given \narea and the present endeavour should also aim for restoration of the maximum saturation for \na given hydrogeological set up. There are few states like Rajasthan where the water level is \nvery deep in the historical past also. Similarly, the states with undulating terrain will have steep \nhydraulic gradient and the saturation up to 3 m below ground level is not logical.

    "arly, the states with undulating terrain will have steep \nhydraulic gradient and the saturation up to 3 m below ground level is not logical.  The post -\nmonsoon depth to water level represents a situation of minimum thickness of vadose zone \navailable for recharge which can be considered vis-à-vis surplus monsoon run off in the area. \nIn view of the above, depth below 3 m from ground level is taken for estimation of th ickness \nof available unsaturated zone in post monsoon period for most of the states. However, some \nof the States also have taken different criteria based on the prevailing hydrogeological \nsituations and have been discussed in the respective State section. Further, shallow level is \nconsidered in coastal and island aquifers, where the head above mean sea level should be \nraised to a maximum possible extent to keep the fresh water-salt water interface at safe level. \nDepth to water level map for post monsoon period of 2018 is presented inFig. 3.1.The artificial \nrecharge techniques inter relate and integrate the source water to ground water reservoir.  \nThis results in rise in water level and increment in the total volume of the ground water \nreservoir. \n \n3.3 Traditional water harvesting Systems \nThe water harvesting in India has been very old features and some of the structures can also \nfunction as indirect recharge structures, facilitating the movement water to groundwater \nsystem.

The following aspects were considered for \npreparation of the plan: \nIdentification and prioritization of need based areas for artificial recharge to ground water. \nEstimation of sub surface storage space based on the water table behaviour and quantity \nof water needed to saturate the unsaturated zone (up to a depth of 3 to 8 m bgl depending \non the prevailing hydraulic conditions and zone of fluctuation in the state, to fully utilize the \nunsaturated zone without allowing water logging condition) \nQuantification of local surplus annual run off availability as source water for artificial \nrecharge in each sub basin/watershed and possibility of transporting surplus run off from \nadjoining watersheds/sub-basins also to be considered. \nAreas of poor chemical quality of ground water and scope of improvement by suitable \nrecharge measures. \nWorking out design of suitable recharge structures, their n umbers and type; storage \ncapacity and efficiency considering t",
    "ty of ground water and scope of improvement by suitable \nrecharge measures. \nWorking out design of suitable recharge structures, their n umbers and type; storage \ncapacity and efficiency considering the estimated storage space and available source \nwater for recharge. \nCost estimates of artificial recharge structures required to be constructed in identified \nareas. \n \nThe generalised methodology followed in the country is described below and due to data \nconstraints, small tweaking of the methodology was made in some States and have been \ndescribed in State wise discussion. \n4.1 Identification of Feasible Areas \nThe areas feasible for artificial recha rge have been demarcated into different categories as \nfollows in most of the states: \nAreas showing post monsoon water levels deeper than 3 m bgl and declining trend of more \nthan 10 cm/year in plains  \nPost monsoon Water level above 4 to 8 m in undulating/ hilly terrain and poor rainfall with \ndeep water table zones. \nAreas with deeper pressure head in known principal aquifers.  \nAreas having less fresh water lenses in coastal/island aquifers  \n \nIn addition, water scares areas, over exploited areas have also been  included to bring about \nan overall improvement in groundwater levels. The water table map, long term trend map were \nsuper imposed to demarcate the area identified for artificial recharge. In some States, category \nmap and water scarcity area map were also super imposed to include more areas for artificial \nrecharge.  \n4.2 Estimation of Available Storage \nThe thickness of available unsaturated zone (below 3 bgl) described earlier is estimated by \nconsidering the different ranges of water level.  The different ra nges of DTW (depth to water \nlevel) are averaged to arrive at thickness of unsaturated zone. The total volume of unsaturated \nstrata is calculated by considering the above categories and unsaturated thickness of different \nranges.

This volume was then multip lied by average specific yield on an area specific basis \nto arrive at volume of water required to saturate the aquifer to 3 m bgl. \n \n \n \n4.3 Source water Requirement \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n19 \n \n \nAfter assessing the volume of water required for saturating the vadose zone, the actual \nrequirement of source water is to be estimated.  Based on the experience gained in the \npilot/demonstrative recharge projects implemented in different hydrogeological situations, an \naverage recharge efficiency of 75% of the individual structure is considered. Th e volume of \nsource water required for artificial recharge was calculated by multiplying a factor of 1.33 (i.e. \nreciprocal of 0.75).  In few cases different values are taken depending upon the regional \nscenario prevailing thereupon.  \n4.4 Source Water Availability \nThe surface water resources available in various basins and sub basins utilized for preparation \nof plan were based on information mostly provided by State Government.  In few cases \ninformation from other Government Agencies were considered. The data availability for source \nwater availability for each sub basin includes committed run off& provision for future planning. \nThe surplus water available is then worked out by subtracting the committed supply form total \navailability. The basis/sub basin wise surplus availability is apportioned to District. \n4.5 Capacity of Recharge Structures \nThe capacity of recharge structures was worked out based on the findings of various artificial \nrecharge studies under taken in different States and the same was used for pl anning the \nrecharge structures.Maximum storage capacity (single filling) and gross capacity due to \nmultiple fillings during rainy season were taken into consideration for design",
    "same was used for pl anning the \nrecharge structures.Maximum storage capacity (single filling) and gross capacity due to \nmultiple fillings during rainy season were taken into consideration for designing percolation \ntanks, cement plugs, check dams and other surface storage struc tures. The number of rainy \ndays and the possible number of fillings to the proposed recharge structure (3 to 5 fillings for \ncheck dams, 2 to 3 fillings for ponds etc) is also taken into consideration. \n4.6 Number of Recharge Structures \nThe numbers of recharge structures required to store and recharge the ground water reservoir \nhave been worked out as follows: - \n \n  Total surplus Surface Water runoff Considered \nNo. of Structures = --------------------------------------------------------------------------    \nAverage Gross Capacity of Water Spreading  \nRecharge Structures (Considering Multiple Fillings) \n \nThe type and design of different types of structures like percolation tanks, check dams, \nrecharge shafts etc. in a particular block/watershed would be guided by p revailing \nhydrogeological situation, existing density and number of structures, land availability etc. The \nplanning of type and design of proposed structures should accordingly be decided. The \nallocation of source water for recharge through specific type o f artificial recharge structures \nshould be done considering these aspects. In case of deeper aquifers, injection wells are \nrecommended on the basis of thickness of aquifer and status of ground water withdrawal and \nthe feasibility of gravity injection at safe rate obtained from trial tests at Neyveli aquifer in Tamil \nNadu. Few structures are based on conceptual projection, which can be fine -tuned by more \nsite specific field studies during preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n20 \n \n \nCHAPTER 5.0 \n5.0 DESIGN OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE STRUCTURES \nA wide spectrum of tec",

The artificial recharge technique will vary in consonance with the \nvariations in hydrogeological framework.  The artificial recharge structures, which are feasible \nin varied hydrogeological situation, are described as follows: \n5.1  Percolation Tanks \nPercolation tank is an artificially created surface water body, submerging in its reservoir highly \npermeable land areas, so that the surface run off is made to percolate and recharge the ground \nwater storage.  The percolation tank should have adequate catchment area. The \nhydrogeological condition of site for percolation tank is of utmost importance. The rocks \ncoming under submergence area should have high permeability. The degree and extent of \nweathering of rocks should be uniform and not just localized.  The purpose of percolation tank \nis to conserve the surface run off and diverts the maximum possible surface water to th e \nground water storage. Thus the water accumulated in the tank after monsoon should percolate \nat the earliest, without much evaporation losses.   \nThe size of a percolation tank should be governed by the percolation capacity of the strata in \nthe tank bed ra ther than yield of the catchment.  For, in case the percolation rate is not \nadequate, the impounded water is locked up and wasted more through evaporation losses, \nthus depriving the downstream area of the valuable resource.These are the most prevalent \nstructures in India as a measure to recharge the groundwater reservoir both in alluvial as well \nas hard rock formations. The efficacy and feasibility of these structures is more in hard rock \nformation where the rocks are highly fractured and weathered.  In the States of Maharashtra, \nAndhra Pradesh,",
    "rd rock formations. The efficacy and feasibility of these structures is more in hard rock \nformation where the rocks are highly fractured and weathered.  In the States of Maharashtra, \nAndhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat, the percolation tanks have been \nconstructed in plenty in basaltic lava flows and crystalline rocks. The percolation tanks are, \nhowever, also feasible in mountain fronts occupied by talus scree deposits.  The percolation \ntanks can also be constructed in the Bhabar zone. Percolation tanks with wells and shafts can \nalso be constructed in areas where shallow or superficial formations are highly impermeable \nor clayey. \n5.1.1 Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines \nA detailed analysis of rainfall pattern, number of rainy days, dry spells and evaporation rate \nand detailed hydrogeological studies to demarcate suitable percolation tank sites, is \nnecessary. In Peninsular India with semi-arid climate, the storage capacity of percolation tank \nis designed such that the water percolates to ground water reservoir by January/February. \nThe submergence area should be in uncultivable land as far as possible. Percolation tank be \nlocated on highly fractured and weathered rock for speedy recharge.  In case of alluvium, the \nbouldary formations are ideal for locating percolation tanks. The aquifer to be recharged \nshould have sufficient thickness of permeable vadose zone to accommodate recharge. The \nbenefited area should have sufficient number of wells and cultivable land to develop the \nrecharged water. Detailed hydrological studies for run off assessment be done and designed \ncapacity should not normally be more than 50 percent of total quantum of rain fall in catchment. \nWaste weir or spillway is suitably designed based on single day maximum rain fall to allow \nflow of surplus water after the tank is filled to its maximum capacity.

To avoid erosion of embankment \ndue to ripple action stone pitching be provided upstream up to highest flood level (HFL). \n5.2  Check Dam / Cement Plug / Nala Bund \nCheck Dams are constructed across small streams having gentle slope and are feasible both \nin hard rock as well as alluvial formation.  The site selected for check dam should have \nsufficient thickness of permeable bed or weathered formation to facilitate recharge of stored \nwater within short span of time.  The water stored in these structure s is mostly confined to \nstream course and the height is normally around 2 m.  These are designed based on stream \nwidth and excess water is allowed to flow over the wall.  In order to avoid scouring from excess \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n21 \n \n \nrun off, water cushions are provided at down streamside.  To harness the maximum run off in \nthe stream, series of such check dams can be constructed to have recharge on a regional \nscale. The peak flow should not create bank erosion and damage to structures.  \nA series of small bunds or weirs are made across selected nala sections such that the flow of \nsurface water in the stream channel is impeded and water is retained on pervious soil/ rock \nsurface for longer period Nala -Bunds are constructed across bigger nala or second order \nstreams in areas having g entler slopes.  A nala bund acts like a mini percolation tank with \nwater storage confined to stream course.  \n5.2.1  Site Characteristics and Design Guidelines \nFor selecting a site for Check Dams/ Nala Bunds the following aspects may be observed  \nThe total catchment of the nala should normally be between 40 to 100 Hectares though \nthe local situations can be guiding factor for this. \nThe width of nala bed should be at least",
    "s may be observed  \nThe total catchment of the nala should normally be between 40 to 100 Hectares though \nthe local situations can be guiding factor for this. \nThe width of nala bed should be at least 5 meters and not exceed 15 meters and the depth \nof bed should not be less than 1 meter. \nThe lands downstream of Check Dam/ Bund should have land under well irrigation. \nThe rock strata exposed in the ponded area should be adequately permeable to cause \nground water recharge through ponded water. \nThe structures should not block the flow of wate r during the rainfall totally and hence the \nsufficient carrying capacity of nala/stream should be ensured.  \n \n5.3  Gabion Structure \nThis is a kind of check dam being commonly constructed across small stream to conserve \nstream flows with practically no subme rgence beyond stream course.  The boulders locally \navailable are stored in a steel wire. This is put up across the stream to make a small dam by \nanchoring it to the streamside.  The height of such structures is around 0.5 m and is normally \nused in the streams with width of about 10 to 15 m.  The excess water overflows this structure \nleaving some storage water to serve as source of recharge.  The silt content of stream water \nis deposited in the interstices of the boulders in due course to make it more imperm eable.  \nThese structures are common in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra \nPradesh, etc. \n5.4  Modification of Village Tanks As Recharge Structure \nThe existing village tanks which are normally silted and damaged can be modified to serve as \nrecharge structure in case these are suitably located to serve as percolation tanks.  In general, \nno “Cut Off Trench” (COT) and Waste Weir is provided for village tanks.  Desilting, coupled \nwith providing proper waste weir and COT on the upstream side, the vi llage tanks can be \nconverted into recharge structure.  Several such tanks are available which can be modified for \nenhancing ground water recharge. S",
    "r waste weir and COT on the upstream side, the vi llage tanks can be \nconverted into recharge structure.  Several such tanks are available which can be modified for \nenhancing ground water recharge. Studies, however, are needed to ascertain whether the \nvillage tanks are suitably located to serve as recharge  structures. Some of the tanks in \nMaharashtra and Karnataka have been converted into percolation tanks. \n5.5  Dug Well Recharge \nIn alluvial as well as hard rock areas, there are thousands of dug wells which have either gone \ndry or the water levels have declined considerably.  These dug wells can be used as structures \nto recharge ground water.  The storm water, tank water, canal water, etc. can be diverted into \nthese structures to directly recharge the dried aquifer.  By doing so the soil moisture losses \nduring the normal process of recharge, are reduced.  The recharge water is guided through a \npipe to the bottom of well, below the water level to avoid scoring of bottom and entrapment of \nair bubbles in the aquifer.  The quality of source water including the silt content should be such \nthat the quality of ground water reservoir is not deteriorated. In rural areas the rain water runoff \ncan be channelized and recharged to dug wells through a filter. \n \n \n5.6  Recharge Shafts \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n22 \n \n \nIn areas where phreatic aquifer is overlain by poorly permeable strata, the recharge to ground \nwater storage by water spreading method becomes ineffective or has very low efficiency. This \nsituation also occurs in ponds/depressions where due to siltation an impermeable layer or lens \nis formed which affects hydraulic connection of surface water and phreatic aquifers. Recharge \nshaft is an artificial recharge structure which penetrates the overlying impervious horizon and \nprovides affective access of surface water for recharging the phreatic aquifer. These structures \nare ideally suited",
    "rtificial recharge structure which penetrates the overlying impervious horizon and \nprovides affective access of surface water for recharging the phreatic aquifer. These structures \nare ideally suited for areas with deep water levels. In areas where low permeable sandy \nhorizon is within shallow depths, a trench can be excavated to 3 m depth and back filled with \nboulder and gravel. The trench can be provided with recharge shaft to effectively recharge the \ndeeper aquifers. \n \n5.6.1  Site Characteristic And Design Guidelines \nThe following are the site characteristics and design guidelines: \nTo be dug manually if the strata is of non-caving nature. \nIf the strata are caving, proper permeable lining should be provided. \nThe diameter of shaft should normally be more than 2 m to accommodate more water and \nto avoid eddies in the well. \n \n5.7 Injection Well \nThe aquifer to be replenished is generally one which is already over exploited b y tube well \npumpage and the declining trend of water levels in the aquifer has set in.  Because of the \nconfining layers of low permeability the aquifer cannot get natural replenishment from the \nsurface and needs direct injection through recharge wells.  Ar tificial Recharge of aquifers by \ninjection well is also done in coastal regions to arrest the ingress of sea water and to combat \nthe problems of land subsidence in areas where confined aquifers are heavily pumped. \nIn alluvial areas injection well rechargin g a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can be \nconstructed in a fashion similar to normal gravel packed pumping well. The only difference is \nthat cement sealing of the upper section of the well is done in order to prevent the injection \npressures from forci ng leakage of water through the annular space of borehole and well \nassembly.  In hard rock areas casing and well screens may not be required.  An injection pipe \nwith opening against the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient.  However, in case of \nnumber of permeable",
    "mbly.  In hard rock areas casing and well screens may not be required.  An injection pipe \nwith opening against the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient.  However, in case of \nnumber of permeable horizons separated by impervious rocks, a properly designed injection \nwell may be constructed with slotted pipe against the aquifer to be recharged.  In practice the \ninjection rates are limited by the physical characteristics of the aquifer.  In the vicinity of well, \nthe velocity of ground water flow may increase to the point that the aquifer is eroded, especially \nif it is made up of unconsolidated or semi -consolidated rocks.  In confined aquifer, confining \nlayers may fail if too great pressur e is created under them.  If this occurs, the aquifer will \nbecome clogged in the vicinity of the borehole and/or may collapse. Hence, care may be taken \nto design the injection discharge, which are generally equal to the yield of the well.  \n \n5.8 Ground Water Dams Or Sub Surface Dykes Or Underground Bandharas \nThese are basically ground water conservation structures and are effective to provide \nsustainability to ground water structures by delimiting sub surface flow. A ground water dam \nis a sub surface barrier  across stream which retards the natural ground water flow of the \nsystem and stores water below ground surface to meet the demands during the period of \nneed.  The main purpose of ground water dam is to arrest the flow of ground water out of the \nsub-basin and increase the storage within the aquifer.  This helps in rising of water levels in \nupstream part of ground water dam rise, thus saturating the otherwise dry part of aquifer. \n \n5.9  Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n23 \n \n \nIn Urban areas, the roof top rain water can  be conserved and used for recharge of ground \nwater.

    "In Urban areas, the roof top rain water can  be conserved and used for recharge of ground \nwater.  This approach requires connecting the outlet pipes from roof top to divert the water to \neither existing wells/ tube wells/ bore well or specially designed wells.  The urban housing \ncomplexes or institutional buildings have large roof area and can be utilized for harvesting roof \ntop rain water and recharging. \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n24 \n \n \nCHAPTER 6.0 \n6.0 MONITORING MECHANISM \nThe monitoring of water levels and water quality is of prime importance in any scheme of \nartificial recharge to ground water.  The monitoring data speaks for the efficacy of structures \nconstructed for artificial recharge and greatly helps in taking effective measures for ground \nwater management on scientific lines. As such the plan for artificial recharge should have the \nmonitoring mechanism inbuilt with the scheme. \n \n6.1 Water Level Monitoring \nThe monitoring of surface water and ground water levels during feasibility studies greatly help \nin identifying the method of artificial recharge. Network of observation wells is  used to study \nthe ground water flow pattern and temporal changes in potentiometric head in the aquifer. \nThe observation well network during feasibility stage is generally of low density, spread over \na large area with the primary aim of defining the bounda ry zonation of the aquifer to be \nrecharged and to know the hydraulic characteristics of the natural ground water system.  After \nidentification of the feasible ground water structures, the observation well network is redefined \nin a smaller area with greater well density.  The objective of monitoring system is to study the \neffect of artificial recharge on the natural ground water system.  Depending on the method of \nartificial recharge and the hydrogeology of the area, the observation well network has to be \ndesigned.   \nThe monitoring system o",

Depending on the method of \nartificial recharge and the hydrogeology of the area, the observation well network has to be \ndesigned.   \nThe monitoring system of observation well network should be designed specially to monitor \nimpact of individual structures which can further be extended and dovetailed to monitor the \nimpact of group of such structures in the artificial recharge sc heme area.  The network of \nobservation wells should be  \nadjacent to the recharge facility  \nat a sufficient distance from the recharge facility to observe composite effects and  \nnear the limit of hydrological boundaries.   \nIf the recharged aquifer is overlain by confining/ semi-confining layer, piezometers should be \ninstalled to monitor the water levels of overlying and underlying aquifers which helps in the \nstudy of leakages etc. Where the surface water bodies are hydraulically connected with the \naquifers which are being recharged, it is advisable to monitor the water level profiles of both \nsurface water and ground water. \nThe periodic monitoring of water levels can demarcate the zone of benefit.  In this method a \nnetwork of observation wells is established i n the area likely to be benefitted to study the \nfollowing: \nIn the zone benefitted, the water levels be observed as to whether the well hydrographs \nhave a flat apex during the time when there is water in the recharge structure (tank, pit, \netc.) \nWells situated outside the zone of influence normally show an angular apex for the period \nwhen the recharge is taking place, while those situated within the zone of influence have \na flatter area. \nThe recession limbs of hydrograph wells close to a recharge structure no rmally have a \ngentle gradient as compared to those located far off. Crops in the zone of influence will be \nhealthy compared to those outside such an area.

    "s in the zone of influence will be \nhealthy compared to those outside such an area.  Furthermore, in the zone of influence \nthere is a tendency by the farmers to grow crops with high water requirements. Well yields \nin the zone of influence are generally being greater than those outside it.  The wells in \nbenefitted zones may have more sustainability in lean period than those outside. \nThe above criteria can be used to define the zone of influence and thereby, a real and temporal \ndemarcation of the effectiveness of recharges structures. \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n25 \n \n \n6.2  Tracer Technique for Demarcating Zone Of Benefit \nTracers are useful in demarcating the area benefitted by artificial recharge, Tritium; \nRodhomine B, fluorescent dye and environmental isotopes, etc. are quite useful in assessing \nthe extent of recharge and efficiency of recharge structures. \n \n6.3  Water Quality Monitoring \nThe monitoring of water quality during the implementation of artificial recharge schem es is \nessential to maintain the quality standards for specified uses of the augmented resource.  In \ncase of injection wells the composition of native water in the aquifer and the recharged water \nis important to know prevent clogging of well and aquifer due  to excessive precipitation of \nsalts.  The data on the chemical quality of native water and the changes which may take place \nduring the implementation of artificial recharge schemes should be collected by regular \nsampling from observation well network.  Wh ere treated wastewater is used for recharge a \ncareful monitoring is required to detect any possibility of contamination through a network of \nmonitoring wells.  Thus, the type of water quality monitoring programme depends on the \nspecific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water quality; effect of soil salinization \nand prevention of any contamination etc.  The samples to be collected will also depe",
    "e depends on the \nspecific problem being studied i.e. changes in ground water quality; effect of soil salinization \nand prevention of any contamination etc.  The samples to be collected will also depend on the \npurpose and are generally categorized into  \nIndicative: The indicative samples are collected at 1 to 4 months intervals and used to \nascertain the presence of injected effluent.   \nBasic: Basic samples are taken at monthly intervals for wells already influenced by \nrecharge to determine the effect of recharge effluent on ground water quality and the \npurification provided by flow through the soil and aquifer system.   \nComprehensive: Comprehensive samples are taken at intervals of 6 months to 1 year for \nobservation wells to determine water quality with respect to specific standards for intended \nwater use. \n \n6.4  Impact Assessment \nThe groundwater system is characterised by many points of recharge and many points of \ndischarge. Groundwater system is hence dynamic and ever changing due to natural flow \npattern guided by head difference. Hence due to simultaneo us addition and withdrawal from \nthe groundwater system, the impact of artificial recharge measures may not result in water \nlevel rise. Hence the impacts can be reflected by indirect impacts other than rise in water \nlevels, as enumerated below. \nArresting of Declining water level (rate/absolute Vale) \nGround water structures in the benefited zone of the structures gains sustainability  \nWells provide water in lean months.  \nLonger duration of pumping or increase in number of pumping days. \nReduced pumping hours but constant command area \nCropping pattern in the benefited zone may undergo marked changes  \nIncrease in the area covered by water intensive crops \nMore area with the same crop coverage \nIn spite of having a monsoon failure, the cropped area remains the same.  \nGreen vegetation cover may increase in the zone of benefit and also along the periphery \nof the structures due to increase in soil",

The \ncentral and State government has taken up schemes for augmentation of groundwater over \nthe years. A bird’s eye view of the need and proposal for augmentation was prepared by \nCGWB in 2013 and a need was felt to revise the same. Accordingly, the master plan has been \nrevised and country level estimation is discussed in this chapter and State level estimations is \ndiscussed in the subsequent chapter. \n \n7.1 Identified Area  \nThe area for artificial recharge has been identified based on post monsoon water level (2018) \nand long term post monsoon water trend in most of the States & UTs. However, due to paucity \nof data and local groundwater issues, additional/different criteria were used in different \nStates/UTs and have been discussed under each State/UT separately in next chapter. In the \ncase of NE States, UT of Jammu & Kashmir & UT of Ladakh, the criteria of water scarcity have \nbeen used and structures have been suggested to harness the run off generated from the \nrain. In case of UT of Lakshadweep & UT of Daman & Diu, due to shallow groundwater level, \nonly RTRWH has been suggested.

Hence source water availability is \nconsidered as Harnessable water for artificial recharge \n \n7.2 Scope of Artificial Recharge \nThe scope of artificial recharge depends on the availab le sub surface space for recharge, \nwater required for recharge and surplus water available for recharge. The volume of space \navailable up to 3m bgl or 5m bgl depending on the criteria adopted in different States multiplied \nby the specific yield of the aquifers will provide the space available for recharge. Considering \nan efficiency of 60% or 75% as deemed fit in different States, the water required for artificial \nrecharge has been worked out for each State. The surplus available for recharge after \ndeducting the committed supply has been estimated for each State. The scope of artificial \nrecharge for each State has been provided in Table 7.1. \nA perusal of the table shows that an area of 11.23 Lakh sq.km has been identified for artificial \nrecharge, with availab le space for artificial recharge works out to be 53 7.349 BCM. \nConsidering an efficiency of 60 to 70%, water required for recharge works out to be of the \norder of 716.917 BCM. However, the surplus available for recharge is of the order of 185.092 \nBCM.  \nIn t he committee meeting, the representative from CWC opined that surplus available for \nrecharge needs to be checked up and not to be consider",
    "ailable for recharge is of the order of 185.092 \nBCM.  \nIn t he committee meeting, the representative from CWC opined that surplus available for \nrecharge needs to be checked up and not to be consider new structures in the catchment area \nof the big dam, which may result in reduction of flow to Dams. In case of first point, CWC \nsuggested that only 240 BCM is available as unutilized from the utilizable water, which can \nonly be considered as surplus.  Subsequently, the information on availability of water was \nobtained from CWC as given below. \n Surface water Groundwater Total \nTotal precipitation (BCM)   3880 \nTotal water availability after losses (BCM)   1999 \nTotal Utilizable water (BCM) 690 432 1122 \nTotal water  Utilized (BCM) 450 249 699 \n \nThe artificial recharge measures are intended to harvest the rain through small  structures at \nthe places, where it falls, which may include hitherto considered unavailable after deducting \nthe losses (3880 -1999 = 1881 BCM) and the balance unutilized water from utilizable water \n(240 BCM). Hence the surplus source water estimated in the  revision may be considered as \navailable at present and detailed surplus availability needs to be worked out and updated as \na separate project.  \n \n7.3 Artificial Recharge & Cost Estimate \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2020) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n28 \n \n \nThe types of structures are decided by the terrain conditions and the number of structures are \ndecided by the source water availability. The different type of structures suitable for different \nterrain conditions and the use of different terminology for the similar structures in various \nStates have resulted in more than 25 types of structures. In order to group different structures \nand bring in standardization, the structures were studied and grouped in to 10 groups and in \nthe group “Others” all the uncommon structures are classified and the grouping of various \nStructures for each State is given in T",
    "tion, the structures were studied and grouped in to 10 groups and in \nthe group “Others” all the uncommon structures are classified and the grouping of various \nStructures for each State is given in Table 7.2. It is also pertinent to point out that percolation \ntank in Dadra Nagar Haveli, is very large of about 100 Ha, while in rest of the States, it will be \nless than 1 ha. Hence the structure and its connotations are different i n different States. \nFurther, in respect of RTRWH, in the absence of data, a percentage of houses and roof tops \nhave been assumed in the calculations. In some States, unit cost per household has been \ngiven while in some unit cost is per unit area. In the States of UP for RTRWH and in Rajasthan \nfor Catchment Area Treatment, unit cost is given per unit area and hence in these State, the \nnumber of structures for this activity has been excluded in the calculation but has been \nincluded in the calculation of cost.   A summary of number of structures under various \ncategories in various States/UTs is tabulated in Table 7.3 and illustrated in Fig 7.1. A perusal \nof the table and figure shows that about 75% of structures are towards RTRWH, while 17% is \nfor others, with 3% for RS, with 2% of structures are in the category of CD & Gabion structures \nand 1% under PT category. The unit cost of structure also is found varying within the States \nfor different districts for some States, while in some States/UTs they have assumed a uniform \nrate. The cost of the structures for each State has been given in Table 7.4 & Fig 7.2.  A perusal \nof the table indicates that RTRWH account for 28% & “others” category account for 23% of \ncost each, while for CD & PT for 19% & RS for 07% of cost. Considering RTRWH is for Urban \nAreas and rest of the structures for Rural Areas and in addition, RS considered in UT of \nChandigarh is also being taken in Urban areas, the cost of estimates for urban and rural areas \nwork out to be Rs 36794.23 Cr (28%) & Rs 96735.45 Cr",

    "tate is the 7th largest state in India covering geographical area of 1.63 Lakh \nKm2 and lies between NL 12° 37’ and 19° 09’ and EL 76° 45’ and 84° 47’. The State is bordered \non the east by Bay of Bengal (~970 km), south by Tamilnadu and Karnataka, west by \nKarnataka and Telangana and north by Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Orissa states. The State \nis divided into 13 dist ricts and 670 revenue mandals with 17398 revenue villages. Total \npopulation of the state (2011 census) is ~4.96 crores out of which 90 % lives in rural area and \n10% in urban area. Andhra Pradesh is mainly drained by Godavari and Krishna Rivers and \ntheir tributaries in the northern, central parts and Pennar River drains the southern parts. There \nare 3 major basins and 11 medium river basins in the state. The normal annual rainfall of the \nstate is 950 mm. The annual (2018) rainfall ranges from 391 mm in Anantapur district (deficit \nby 32%) to 1301 mm (excess by 12%) in Srikakulam district. Major part of the State is underlain \nby gneissic complex with a structural fill of sedimentary formations and basin -fill of meta -\nsedimentary formations.  \n8.1.1 Identification of Area \nThe area suitable for ground water augmentation through artificial recharge has been \ndemarcated based on the analysis of average post-monsoon depth to water level data of the \nobservation wells for the period 2009 -2018 and the existing data on arti ficial recharge \nstructures constructed under various schemes of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) and Integrated Watershed Management \nPrograms (IWMP) by Rural Development department, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly, \nan area of 83,914 sq.kms is identified which is spread over in 395 mandals in 13 districts of \nthe State. The remaining area of 21,883 sq.kms comprises of 138 mandals  have water level \nless than 5 m bgl and an area of 30,712 sq.kms comprises of 137 mandals have sufficient \nnumber of existing artificial recharge structures henc",
    "1,883 sq.kms comprises of 138 mandals  have water level \nless than 5 m bgl and an area of 30,712 sq.kms comprises of 137 mandals have sufficient \nnumber of existing artificial recharge structures hence, no scope for taking up artificial \nrecharge.  \n \n8.1.2 Sub Surface Storage Space: \nThe availability of unsaturated sub surface volume of aquifers in each district is computed as \nthe product of area, thickness of aquifer zone between 5 m. bgl and the average post-monsoon \nwater level. The unsaturated sub surface zone is estimated as 7,97,434 MCM.  The available \nunsaturated volume for recharge is estimated by multiplying the unsaturated sub sur face \nvolume with specific yield of the aquifers. The available unsaturated volume for recharge is \n15,948 MCM in the State. The water required to saturate the aquifer up to 5 m bgl is calculated \nas 21212 MCM considering 77% of the efficiency of the structures. (Table 8.1.1) \n \n8.1.3 Source Water Availability \nThe source water availability is estimated from the rain fall and run off correlations. The runoff \nwas calculated by taking into account of normal monsoon rainfall of the mandal and \ncorresponding runoff yield from Strange Table for average catchment type. Out of the total run \noff available in the mandal, only 20% is considered for recommendation of artificial recharge \nstructures considering the riparian rights and other practical considerations for recommending \nthe artificial recharge structures.

The state \nencompassing a geographical area of 94,163 sq. km. is underlain by extensive water bearing \nformations down to hundreds of meters depth, particularly in the northern parts and the parts \nadjoining the Ganga River. These alluvial deposits are represented by alternating, regionally \nextensive, layers of sands of various grade separated b y clay layers, forming prolific aquifer \nsystem. However, due to deficit rainfalls during recent years in the state, coupled with \nproliferation of ground water development, specially agri -irrigation sector,resulted in to \nsubstantial decline in ground water level in the State. With this scenario at hand, Master Plan \nfor Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in Bihar has been prepared with prime concern of \nrevival of surface water bodies as the revitalized surface water bodies will recharge \ngroundwater reservoir and their network will provide farmers an alternative irrigation option, \nfree from over dependence on groundwater. \n \n8.2.1 Identification of Areas  \nIdentification of the area suitable for artificial recharge has been done on the basis of depth of \npost-monsoon water level and ground water level trend. Using GIS tools, post -monsoon \n(November, 2019) depth-to-",
    "n of the area suitable for artificial recharge has been done on the basis of depth of \npost-monsoon water level and ground water level trend. Using GIS tools, post -monsoon \n(November, 2019) depth-to-water level map and long-term (2007-2017) trend of ground water \nlevel map has been superimposed over administrative boundary to identify feasible areas for \nrecharge. For this purpose, depth -to-water level contour maps are prepared based on \ncombined datasets of CGWB and MWRD, Govt. of Bihar. Using the prepared map, feasible \nareas are identified (Fig 8.2.1), subject to fulfilling the below mentioned conditions.  \nAreas showing water levels between 3 and 6 m bgl and declining trend of > 10 cm /yr;  \nAreas with Depth-to-Water levels between 6 and 9 m bgl and declining trend;  \nAreas with Depth-to-Water levels > 9 m bgl with or without declining trend.  \nAdditionally, “Semi-Critical”, “Critical” or “Over Exploited” Blocks from GWRA -2017 has \nalso been considered for artificial recharge. \n \n8.2.2 Subsurface Storageand Water Requirement  \nStorage space available for recharge i.e. net unsaturated volume in identified areas i s \ndetermined by computation of average depth of the unsaturated zone below 3 m bgl and then \nmultiplied by area considered for recharge. Further, norm-based specific yield values, based \nupon nature of aquifer material, are multiplied to arrive at volume of water required for artificial \nrecharge for each identified area. Gross volume of source water required for artificial recharge \nis estimated considering average recharge efficiency of 65%, as clay dominated younger \nalluvium is present at top of stratigraphic horizon in major parts of the State. Volume of source \nwater required for artificial recharge purpose is calculated by multiplying a factor of 1.54 ( i.e. \nreciprocal of 0.65). Sub -surface storage potential in the state, thus estimated, is 8751 MCM \nas in 2017. Gross volume of source water required, to fill up the space is 13476 MCM (Table",

Gross volume of source water required, to fill up the space is 13476 MCM (Table \n8.2.1). \n \n8.2.3 Source Water Availability  \nAvailability of non-committed source water for the purpose of artificial recharge to groundwater \nis the primary concern during the preparation of the plan, as data availability for surplus runoff \nis only river-basin or sub-basin wise. and cannot be directly correlated with identified feasible \nareas for artificial recharge. In earlier estimation, basin wise surface water availability with \n75% dependability has been utilized from 2nd Bihar State Irrigation Commission Report (1994). \nHowever, the commission noted that for South Bihar, rainfall can be directly correlated with \nriver discharge, where as for North Bihar, snow-melt component is so high in southerly flowing \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n42 \n \n \nrivers, that rainfall component is insignificant and cannot be directly correlated with river \ndischarge \n \n \n \n \nFig 8.2.1 Area identified for Artificial Recharge \n \n \nThe report indicates that river basin catchments of Bihar contribute about 28.8 BCM towards \nsurface water resource which is about 9.26% of total surface water resource of the State. \nHence, in the context of the state of Bihar, considering entire non -monsoon rainfall as \ncommitted, excess monsoon rainfall can be safely harnessed to replenish groundwater table \nwithout affecting surface water resource. For the present plan, 60% of the normal monsoon \nrainfall for identified feasible areas is considered as available non- committed surface runoff.  \nDistrict-wise list of identified areas, computed storage volumes and non -committed source \nwater are tabulated in Table 8.2.1. \nTable 8.2.1  Scope of Artificial Recharge in Bihar \nS.No State District \nArea of \nDistrict \n(Sq.Km.) \nArea \nIdentified \nfo",

On the basis of the norm, number of structures has been worked \nout based on gross storage capacity of individual structure.  District-wise numbers of various \ntypes of artificial recharge structures and cost Estimate in Bihar are given in Table – 8.2.3. As \nper estimate, 163 Percolation Tank, 2608 each of Gully Plug & Contour Bunding - Trenching, \nand 122 Check Dam may be constructed in hilly areas of Bihar. In adjoining marginal alluvial \nareas, 357 NalaBunding, 2842 Contour Bunding& Trenching, 5682 Recharge Shaft and 265 \nPercolation Tank may be created to enhance groundwater recharge. On the other hand, in \nvast alluvial tract of Bihar, augmentation of groundwater resource may be achieved through \nrenovation of natural and man-made surface water structures. It is proposed that, De-silting of \nexisting 10658 village tanks /ponds /talaos, De -silting of 44 Sq. km of mauns (Ox-bow lake), \nInjection Well creation in 13811 Village Tanks, and Renovation of 2045 km of traditional ahar-\npyne System may result in expected rise in water table. However, actual numbers of structures \nimplementable may vary significantly based on scale of implementation.District-wise and type-\nwise cost estimates are gi ven in Table – 8.2.3.

Though urbanization is in low key, \npopulation growth in existing urban areas  is exceeding its holding capacity leading to \nencroachment of municipal / government owned water bodies and change in land \ncharacteriza",
    "tion is in low key, \npopulation growth in existing urban areas  is exceeding its holding capacity leading to \nencroachment of municipal / government owned water bodies and change in land \ncharacterization in privately owned water bodies. Based on considerationthat at least one \nsurface water body exists in 10 sq. km urba n area, district -wise number of existing surface \nwater bodies in urban parts of Bihar has been worked out along with cost estimate. Total cost \nfor the works will involve revival of 232 existing surface water bodies with an estimated cost \nof Rs. 23.2 cr (Table 8.2.3). \nRoof-Top Rain Water Harvesting  \nAs per Census (2011), Bihar has about 40,000 Govt. buildings, institutions, schools, hospitals, \nshopping complexes, warehouses etc. in urban and municipal areas of the state. At present, \nthe number may be assumed at 70000. These, buildings may be adopted for implementation \nof first phase roof -top rainwater harvesting, as on an average these buildings should have \nlarge roof area. On the other hand, as per Census (2011), Bihar has 1,77,44,046 residential \nhouses in b oth urban and rural setup. Considering 50% of urban houses and 10% of rural \nhouses qualify for roof -top rainwater harvesting, there are about twenty lakh (20 lakh) such \nhouses in the state. Considering average monsoon rainfall of 1000 mm for the state and 80% \nefficiency of the system with about 100 m2 of roof-area, the state has potential to augment 216 \nMCM of rain water to groundwater resources through roof -top rainwater harvesting. First \nphase implementation of roof-top rainwater harvesting has a potential to recharge 31.5 MCM \nof rain water to groundwater resources. Total cost for the first phase work has been estimated \nto be Rs. 500 crore (Table 8.2.3) \n8.2.5 Total Cost  \nPrepared AR master plan identifies water scarce areas and proposes terrain specific structure \nto create additional surface water bodies as well as for augmentation of groundwater.

    "pared AR master plan identifies water scarce areas and proposes terrain specific structure \nto create additional surface water bodies as well as for augmentation of groundwater. The \ntotal cost estimate for artificial recharge in Bihar is Rs 2606.44 Cr with a break up of Rs \n2106.44 Cr for rural areas & Rs 500.00 Cr for urban areas.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n48 \n \n \n8.3 CHHATTISGARH \nChhattisgarh State has been formed after bifurcation of Madhya Pradesh on 1st November, \n2000, covering an area of 1,35,600 sq km.  The population of the state is 25.54 million (Census \n2011) with density of population as 189 per sq km.  The average annual rainfall of the state is \n1,356 mm.  The state has 3 administrative divisions, 27 districts and 146 development blocks. \nThere are 19,567 populated villages and 114 cities in the state. About 63140.00 sq km area \nof the state is covere d by forest.  The agricultural land and irrigated land in the state is \n59030.00 sq km and 15020.00 sq km respectively (Directorate of Economics & Statistics, \nChhattisgarh, 2017-18). The state comprises of Mahanadi and Godavari basins with small \nparts of Ganga, Narmada and Swarnarekha basins.  These basins can be subdivided into 74 \nmajor watersheds, 8 watersheds of Son and Narmada falling partly in the adjoining Madhya \nPradesh state. \n8.3.1 Identification of the Area \nDepth to water level recorded during post-monsoon (November 2018) period and decadal post \nmonsoon water level trend (November 2009 to 2018) have been considered to identify the \nareas for recharge, as the natural recharge is not enough to compensate the ground water \nwithdrawal. The data of monitoring stations of both CGWB & State Groundwater department \nhave been used in the exercise. A total area of 25667.94sq.km. shows declining trend in \nground water levels. 123 watersheds have been identified in Chhattisgarh in which declining \ntrend of",
    "artment \nhave been used in the exercise. A total area of 25667.94sq.km. shows declining trend in \nground water levels. 123 watersheds have been identified in Chhattisgarh in which declining \ntrend of more than 0 .1 m/yr has been recorded ( Fig 8.3.1). These watersheds have been \nidentified for construction of suitable artificial recharge structures for augmenting the available \nground water resources.  \n8.3.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nTo estimate the available sub surface storage space, a map has been prepared on the basis \nof post monsoon depth to water level of November 2018.  The post monsoon average depth \nto water level is predominantly in the range of 3 to 6 m below ground level. Based on this map, \nthe volume of unsaturated zone available for recharge (up to 3 m below ground level) has \nbeen calculated for each of the block. A total 58237.38 MCM volume of unsaturated zone has \nbeen estimated for the Chhattisgarh state.

    "NWDA data and State Irrigation Department.  The total availability  of \nsource water for recharge works out to be 8609.63 MCM, which far exceeds the total \nrequirement to create the sub-surface storage.  However, for each watershed the requirement \nvis-a-vis the availability (surplus run off) has been taken care and the least of the two has been \nconsidered as available source water for harnessing in artificial recharge structures. The total \nquantum of source water which can be utilized for creation of sub -surface storage works out \nto be 1370.05 MCM for all the 123 identified watersheds. \n8.3.4 Recharge Structures and Cost Estimates \nThe suitable artificial recharge structures in the state are gully plugs, gabion structures, \ncontour bunds in the upper reaches of the watersheds, percolation tanks, nala bunds in the \nrunoff zones and recharge shafts, gravity head wells in downstream areas.  The main artificial \nrecharge structures proposed are given below along with the estimated number of feasible \nstructures and their cost. \nPercolation Tanks  \nPercolation tank is the main artificial recharge structure proposed for effective utilization of the \nsurplus monsoon runoff.  In hard rock areas only 50% of the total estimated surplus surface \nwater resources have been considered for storage in the percolation tanks. As per the \nhydrogeological conditions in Chhattisgarh, an average percolation tank has filling capacity of \n0.10 MCM.  It can actually store 200% of its capacity due to multiple filling during the monsoon.  \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n50 \n \n \n \n \nFig 8.3.1 Area identified for artificial recharge \n21°\n00'\n22°\n00'\n24°\n00'\n23°\n00'\n18°\n20°\n00'\n19°\n00'\n00'\n100\n81° 00' 82° 00' 83° 00' 84° 00'\nkilometres\n\n0 50\n\nBalod\nDhamtari\nRaipur\nRajnandgaon Mahasamund\nBilaspur Janjgir-Champa\nBaloda bazar\nRaigarh\nKawardha\nKorba\nMungeli\nKondagaon\nNarayanpur\nJagdalpur\nDantewada\nBijapur\nSukma\nJashpur\nSurajpur\nBaiku",

The number of feasible percolation \ntank in each identified watershed has been calculated and presented in Table-8.3.2   The total \npercolation tanks feasible in Chhattisgarh are 3426 costing Rs. 1370.4 crore.  \nNala Bunds  \nThere is a large scope for constructing Nala bunds/Cement plugs in various second and third \norder streams of the state.  About 25% of surplus monsoon runoff can be utilized by recharge \nthrough these structures.  The average capacity of Nala bunds/Cement plugs has been \nconsidered as 0.03 MCM.  The average cost of each structure has been taken as Rs.3 lakh.  \nIt is estimated that 11417 Nala bund/Cement plugs can be constructed in the state at the cost \nof 342.5 crore (Table-8.3.2). \nRecharge Shafts & Gravity Head Recharge Wells \nThese structures are feasible in villages and urban pockets. About 15% of the surplus \nmonsoon runoff can be utilized through these structures. The average r echarge capacity \nthrough recharges shafts, gravity head recharge through dug wells during an operational \nperiod of 60 days in monsoon and post monsoon period is considered as 0.008 MCM. The \naverage cost of structure may be taken as Rs.5.0 Lacs. The number of structures and their \ncost for each identified watershed is calculated and presented in Table 8.3.2.

The structures feasible in each \nidentified watershed has been estimated and presented in Table 8.3.2. For the entire State \nfeasible structures total up to 19572 costing Rs 97.9 crore. \n8.3.5 Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting \nThere are 114 urban areas in Chhattisgarh, with total number of houses around 11,83,390. \nDue to scarcity of water, individual houses in most of the urban areas have gone for \nconstruction of bore wells/ dug wells in unplanned way, resu lting in lowering of water levels \nand dwindling of yield/drying up of wells. The availability of rooftop in urban areas is an \nattractive solution for the collection of rainwater during monsoons and recharging to the ground \nwater reservoir. An attempt has b een made to study the feasibility of roof top rainwater \nharvesting in urban areas of the State. Considering the varied hydrogeological and other \nsituations of space availability, even if 10% of the houses with an average roof area of 50 sq. \nmeter are consi dered, a total roof area of 5.91 sq. km is available to collect the rainfall. \nConsidering the average annual normal rainfall in each urban area, the total volume of \nrainwater, which can be collected on roofs, has been worked out, only 85 % of this volume of \nrainwater has been considered as available source water for recharging ground water. The \ntotal available water from roof top rainwater harvesting worked out to 6.812 MCM. The average \nexpenditure on pr",
    "inwater has been considered as available source water for recharging ground water. The \ntotal available water from roof top rainwater harvesting worked out to 6.812 MCM. The average \nexpenditure on providing the necessary arrangements through the fitting s, filter etc to divert \nthe roof water to the existing ground water structure (tube well/dug well) has been considered \nas Rs.50,000/- per house. The total cost for roof top rainwater harvesting in 1,18,339 houses \nof the 114 cities of Chhattisgarh declared as standard urban areas is worked out to be \nRs.591.69 crore. \n8.3.6 Total Cost Estimates  \nThe estimated cost for artificial Recharge and rainwater harvesting works out to Be 3686.8 2 \nCr, out of which cost for artificial recharge in Rural areas works out to b e 3095.12 Cr and in \nurban areas is of the order of Rs 591.69 Cr. \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \nTable 8.3.2 Artificial   Recharge Structures & Cost Estimates \nS.No District \nNumber of Structures Unit Cost of Structures( in Lakhs) Cost of Structures (in Lakhs) \nRS/GHRW \nPT \nGP/CB/ GS \nNB/CP/ KT \nBhandara \nRTRWH \nRS/GHRW \nPT \nGP/CB/ GS \nNB/CP/ KT \nBhandara \nRTRWH \nRS/GHRW \nPT \nGP/CB/ GS \nNB/CP/ KT \nBhandara \nRTRWH \nTotal Cost \n(Lakh) \n1 BALOD 1936 258 1475 860 2468 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 9680.00 10320.00 737.50 2580.00 1234.00 24551.50 \n2 BALODA BAZAR 786 105 599 350 3422 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 3930.00 4200.00 299.50 1050.00 1711.00 11190.50 \n3 BALRAMPUR 441 59 336 196 472 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 2205.00 2360.00 168.00 588.00 236.00 5557.00 \n4 BASTAR 594 79 452 264 3040 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 2970.00 3160.00 226.00 792.00 1520.00 8668.00 \n5 BEMETARA 5287 705 4028 2350 1380 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 26435.00 28200.00 2014.00 7050.00 690.00 64389.00 \n6 BIJAPUR 524 70 399 233 647 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 2620.00 2800.00 199.50 699.00 323.50 6642.00 \n7 BILASPUR 1824 243 1390 811 3414 5.0 40.0 0.5 3.0 0.5 9120.00 9720.00 695.00 2433.00 1707.00 23675.00 \n8 DANTEWADA 27 4",

Delhi mostly being  Urban area, the area feasible for \nartificial recharge is only 843 Sq  Km out of which 190Sq km of roof area, 81Sq Km of paved \narea and the balance 572 Sq Km is open area . Considering 80 % runoff coefficient for roofed \narea, 60% for paved area and 30% for open, the runoff availability for Delhi state is assessed \nas 175 MCM. The surplus monsoon runoff available from Yamuna is 282 MCM. Thus a total \nof 457 MCM surplus runoff is available for recharge to ground water. As the recharge areas \nare at higher elevations, the surplus water of Yamuna river cannot be diverted under gravity \nto these areas. However, the water can be transported to Chhatarpur Basin characterized by \ndeeper water level and can be recharged through percolation ponds or recharge wells. \nPresently considering only the available surface runoff amounting to 175 MCM, the committed \nsupply is of 52 MCM and only the balance of 123 MCM is available for recharge. In the present \ncircumstances only 20% of the uncommitted surplus run off amounting to 24MCM can be \nutilized for artificial recharge to ground water as the most the area is urban and entire rainwater \ncannot be a harvested due to outflow into sewers and other losses.  \n8.4.4 Recharge Structures and Cost Estimates \nBased on the available scientific da ta generated by Central Ground Water Board over the \nyears and based on the scope of artificial recharge, three types of structures are considered, \nviz., Recharge Trench with or without recharge shaft, RTRWH in urban area and check dams \nin ridge area.   \nIn parks and gardens, recharge trenches",

Accordingly, accounting for gross storage capacity of \nexisting all irrigations dams / reservoir and proposed allocation for various schemes, surplus \nrunoff has been worked out for 4 main physiographic regions of the state. This availability so \nworked out for entire 4 regions has been further redistributed on prorate basis for different \ndistricts within the respective regions  for planning of Artificial Recharge. The total surplus \nwater available for planning of artificial recharge in the state is 6194.42 MCM/yr. Considering \nthe various types of artificial recharge structures constructed up to 2020, the balance surplus \nrun off has been calculated to be  4144.27 MCM. However as per the data provided by the \nState Water Resources Department an additional 315 MCM of surplus surface water is \nprovisioned for artificial recharge through recharge shafts and existing defunct tube wells \nwhich can be used as injection wells.

    "911 villages and 165 \ntowns have been covered for piped water supply (ht tp://www.sardarsarovardam.org/water-\nsupply-policy). There are still some urban pockets in Gujarat State depend heavily on ground \nwater for drinking water supplies and groundwater levels are declining. Rainwater harvesting \ncan be used to supplement the water supply and at the same time arrest the declining water \nlevels.  \nThe suitable method for artificial recharge in urban area is to harvest the rainwater from roof \ntops. Depending on hydrogeological condition, the harvested water can be stored and used \ndirectly or can be recharged or the combination of storage and recharge. As per 2011 census \n31 urban centers have been identified where the population exceeds 1 Lakh (Table 7). There \nare about 251.82 Lakh people reside in the urban areas of the State. There are  about 52.83 \nLakh households in such centers and considering about 25% houses are suitable for \nharvesting and considering 40 sq.m. as typical house hold roof top area the total area available \nfor harvesting (90% of total roof top) has been estimated to be 475.54 Lakh sq m. The source \nwater available for harvesting has been taken as 60% of normal rainfall in the urban centre \nafter making allowance for storm rain etc., Thus, the total source water available for harvesting \nhas been estimated as 26.3 MCM/yr.  T he Average cost of making the roof top harvesting \narrangements for storing it at surface and recharging to ground water is @ Rs. 20,000/ - per \nhouse.  Thus, the cost of roof top harvesting for 13.20 lakh houses of the state is estimated \nas Rs. 2641.89 crores (Table 8.6.2) \n \n8.6.5 Total Cost \nThe total cost for proposed artificial recharge is Rs 3462.73 Cr, out of which Rs 820.84 Cr is \nin rural areas and Rs 2641.89 Cr is urban areas. \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n61 \n \n \nTable 8.6.2 Artificial Recharge in Gujarat \n \nS.No. \n \nDistrict \nNumber Of Structure",

It has an areal extent of 44,241  \nsq.km. and forms 1.35 % of the geographical area of the country. Around 97% of the state \narea is plain and known as Indo -Gangetic plain. The state forms the part of Ganga & Indus \nbasin. The normal annual rainfall varies from more than 1000 mm in the north east to less than \n300 mm in the south west. In the south western parts of the state, drought is a common feature.  \nIn the north eastern and eastern parts of the State, fairly thick and regionally extensive \nconfined/unconfined aquifers exist down to a dept h of more than 300 m with yield prospects \nof about 150 m3/hour.  The alluvium down to 450 m below land surface has been explored in \nthis part. In the south -western and the central parts of the State, moderately thick and \nregionally extensive confined/unconfined aquifers exist.  The ground water here is generally \nsaline at all levels except local patches.  The yield prospects in this area are less than 50 \nm3/hour.  In the remaining areas moderately thick and regionally extensive aquifers exist and \ntheir yield prospects are 50-150 m3/hour mainly due to limitation of depth as underlying ground \nwater is saline. In the hard rock areas the ground water potentials are limited and there the \nyield prospects are 5 to 20 m3/hour within weathered residuum and fractured zones.    \nGround water resources of state have been estimated as on 31.03.201",
    "d water potentials are limited and there the \nyield prospects are 5 to 20 m3/hour within weathered residuum and fractured zones.    \nGround water resources of state have been estimated as on 31.03.2017. The Net annual \nreplenishable ground water resource of state has been assessed to be 9.13 BCM against the \nwithdrawal of 12.5 BCM.  The average stage of ground water development in the state is has \nreached to 137%. Out of 128 blocks assessed, 78 fall under ‘Over exploited’ category, 3 in \n‘Critical’, 21 as ‘Semi critical’ and 26 as ‘Safe’ category. The reason for this stage of ground \nwater development is mainly because of decrease in ground water recharge due to reduced \nrainfall, urbanisations etc. These over-exploited aquifers require augmentation for sustaining \nthe ground water abstraction structures. \n8.7.1 Identification of Area \nBased on the post monsoon depth to water level of the year 2018 and long term (2009-2018) \nground water level trends, it has been estimated that approximately 39,381 sq. kms area is \nfeasible for artificial recharge. (Fig 8.7.1). The area feasible for artificial recharge to ground \nwater is demarcated based on criteria of depth to water level of more than 3 m bgl during post-\nmonsoon season and continuous annual decline rate of more than 10 cm per annum.   \n8.7.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nThe total volume of unsaturated strata is calculated  by considering unsaturated thickness of \naquifers on block-wise basis. The sub-surface storage potential is estimated by multiplying the \nvolume of unsaturated aquifer by average specific yield i.e. 12%. The quantity of water \nrequired is estimated by consid ering the recharge efficiency of 75%. Sub surface storage \npotential of the state is estimated as 77,964 MCM during post-monsoon season of 2018. The \nsub-surface storage potential estimated during post-monsoon season of 2012 is about 54175 \nMCM. Thus due to o ver-exploitation about 23789 MCM of volume of aquifer has bee",

Thus due to o ver-exploitation about 23789 MCM of volume of aquifer has been \ndewatered and used-up during the last 6 years.  The quantity of water required for filling the \nsub-surface storage potential (unsaturated zone) is approximately 103693 MCM. District-wise \nbreak up is given in the Table.8.7.1.   \n8.7.3 Source Water Availability \nThe quantity of non-committed surplus surface water in the Haryana state has been estimated \nto be only 679.26 MCM(as per the data available from the state government) against the \nrequirement of 103693 MCM.Thus, the source water for recharge in the State of Haryana can \nbe surplus canal flow, runoff generated in large Farms and rainwater from roof top. The surplus \nwater from canal are proposed to be used for recharging through canal, while the runoff \ngenerated from farm land to be used for farm ponds and by making provision for rooftop \nrainwater harvesting.

The estimated cost of constructing the farm ponds @ rate of 0.50 lakhs per farm pond \nis about 1969 crores.  \n \n8.7.7 Artificial Recharge from Sewage Water \nBesides rainfall, ample scope exists to recharge treated sewage water, which is disposed \naway from the town without any purposeful gain. At present, in majority of the towns sewage \nwater is subjected to primary treatment only. In certain towns, the sewage water is subjected \nto secondary treatment. The towns where treated sewage water is available are Panipat, \nKarnal, Faridabad, Yamunanagar, Gurgaon, Sonepat etc. The total capacity of the plants \ninstalled for treatment in these towns is 0.325 MCM per day. Therefore, t otal treated water \navailability per year is 118.6 MCM. The treated water may be gainfully utilized by storing the \nwater in percolation ponds where ground water levels are deep and allowing the water seep \ninto the ground through a thick layer of unsaturated  zone so that the pollutants may get \nattenuated in unsaturated zone. About 1000 percolation ponds are recommended in the state. \nThe total cost of these structures will be Rs 2500 lacs @ Rs 2.50 lakh per structure. Besides \nthi",

Besides \nthis, there are about 48 urban agg lomerations which are located in the area suitable for \nartificial recharge. The total population of these towns is around 13 lakhs. The sewage \ngenerated from these towns is around 45.5 MCM annually. The sewage in these towns is \nsubjected to primary treatment only, which is not suitable for artificial recharge. If sewage in \nthese towns is given secondary/tertiary treatment, it may be utilized for artificial recharge in \nproximity of the towns. Three pond domestic waste water (only bathroom water and kitchen \nwaste water) treatment system are recommended to be constructed in the villages to treat the \nbathroom water and use the same for irrigational requirements is recommended so that the \nstress on ground water can be reduced.    \n \n8.7.8 Total Cost  \nThere are some major changes in the revised Master Plan to that of 2013. These changes are \nmainly due to revision of recharge structures as recommended in ground water management \nplans prepared during the NAQUIM Plan. Farm Ponds which were not recommended in 2013 \nMaster plan have been incorporated in this Mater Plan as per the recommendations of \nNAQUIM Project.  The rooftop rain water harvesting structures were also revised based on \nthe NAQUIM Project management Plans. Thus the cost of taking up artificial recharge in rural \nand urban areas will be revised and will be Rs 4370.45 crores for all types of recharge \nstructures (Table 8.7.2).

The state is divided int o 24 districts and 260 \ncommunity development blocks. As per census 2011, the Population of the state is 32988134, \nof which about 30% of total population is tribal.The total rural population is 25055073 while \nthe urban population is 7933061.The annual normal rainfall of the state is 1301 mm.The entire \nstate is characterized by land of great inequalities, succession of plateaus, hills, valleys, \nscarps ridges with altitude varying from 40 m to more than 1300 m above mean sea level. The \nstate is covered under t hree major river basins, viz, Lower Ganga, Subarnarekha and \nBrahmani. The state is underlain by diverse rock types of different geological ages ranging \nfrom Archaean to Recent. The major rock types are igneous and metamorphic rocks covering \nnearly 85 percent of the geographical area of the state. \n8.9.1 Identification of Area \nThe area identified for artificial recharge has been made based on post monsoon depth to \nwater level (Nov 2018) more than 3m bgl with declining trend of more than 0.1 m/yr (2009 – \n2018). In addition, area with water level more than 9m bgl and OCS blocks in the State have \nbeen considered and identified area is shown as priority area in Fig 8.9.1. \n \nFig 8.9.1  Area Identified in Jharkhand \n \n8.9.2 Subsurface Storage and Source Water Requirement \nThe volume of unsaturated zone available for recharge in identified areas is determined by \ncomputation of average depth of the unsaturated zone below 3 m bgl and then multiplied by \narea considered for recharge. It is of the order of 56498 MCM. The vol ume available for \nartificial recharge is estimated by multiplying the volume of unsaturated zone with respective \nspecific yield of th",
    "onsidered for recharge. It is of the order of 56498 MCM. The vol ume available for \nartificial recharge is estimated by multiplying the volume of unsaturated zone with respective \nspecific yield of the formation and is of the order of 1324 MCM. Based on the experiences in \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n74 \n \n \nthe State, an efficiency of these artificial recha rge structures is considered as 60% and \naccordingly the water required for artificial recharge is assessed and is of the order of 2197.47 \nMCM. (Table 8.9.1) \n8.9.3 Source Water Availability \nIn the absence of data, the yield from the catchment has been computed using Strange’s table \nand 30% of the monsoon rain fall has been considered. Further, data on committed run off is \nnot available and hence 50% of the estimated run off has been considered available for \nartificial recharge.

    "Karnataka State is underlain by rock types ranging in age fro m Archaean to Recent. Major \nportion of the State is covered by Peninsular Gneisses, Granites and Dharwar Schists of \nArchaean age. Groundwater occurs under unconfined condition in weathered residuum and \nunder semi confined to confined condition in deeper fractures. In general, weathered residuum \nextends down to 30m bgl and fractures are encountered down to 200m bgl, Quality of ground \nwater in general is good and potable in the state except for higher concentration of fluoride \nand nitrates in select districts.  \n8.10.1 Identification ofArea \nThe area characterized by depth to water level more than 3m bgl during the year 2018 post -\nmonsoon period and declining decadal water level trend is considered for artificial recharge. \nIn addition, areas with poor quality of water has also been considered for effecting \nimprovement through dilution and areas with stage of groundwater extraction more than 100% \nhas also been considered for augmentation (Fig.8.10.1). \n8.10.2 Subsurface Storage Space \nThe thickness of unsaturated zone up to the depth of 3m, for each category of depth to water \nlevel has been worked out and volume of unsaturated zone has been estimated. The volume \nof space available for artificial recharge is given by the product of specific yield and volume of \nunsaturated zone and is found to be of the order of 10234 MCM.

The total population of the state as per 2011 census is \n3,33,87,677 with a density of about 859 persons per sq.km. Thiruvananthapuram, with a \npopulation density of 1509 persons per sq.km is the most densely populated district in Kerala \nfollowed by Alappuzha and Kozhikode with 1501 and 1318 persons per sq.km.

Kuttiyadi basin in northern Kerala \nexperiences the highest rainfall of 3934 mm, while Pambar (Amaravathi) basin, which is a rain \nshadow area, records the lowest annual rainfall of 1367 mm. Kerala State is drained by 41 \nwest flowing rivers and 3 east flowing rivers. The Bharathapuzha, Periyar and Pamba are the \nmost important rivers draining the State. The run -off estimated in the state is about 70165 \nMCM out of which 42772 MCM is considered to be utilizable (CGWB, 2013).  \n8.12.1  Identification of Area  \nArea suitable for ground water augmentation through artificial recharge has been demarcated \nbased on the analysis of available data on depth to water level and long -term water level \ntrends. Average Post-monsoon depth to water level data in the observation wells for the period \n2014-18 and water  level trends for the period 2009 -2018 have been used for the analysis, \nbased on which an area of about 11,957sq.km, excluding reserved forests has been identified \nas suitable for implementation of artificial recharge (Fig. 8.12.1).  \n \n8.12.2 Sub Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nIn order to estimate the sub -surface storage space available for recharge, area suitable for \nartificial recharge based on deep (>6m) and declining ground water level trends and average \npost-monsoon water levels were demarc ated in each district. The availability of sub -surface \nstorage space in each district is then computed as the product of area feasible and thickness \nof aquifer zone between 3m bgl and the average post-monsoon water level. The net quantum \nof source water required to saturate the aquifer up to 3m bgl was then computed as the product \nof the storage space available, the average specific yield of the aquifer material and the \nrecharge efficiency of the structures. As per the calculation, the volume of",
    "s then computed as the product \nof the storage space available, the average specific yield of the aquifer material and the \nrecharge efficiency of the structures. As per the calculation, the volume of unsaturated  zone \navailable for recharge below 3m is 810MCM and the quantum of source water required to \nsaturate the available space is 1080 MCM (Table 8.12.1). \n8.12.3  Source Water Availability \nThe data on surface water resources available in various basins in the State were provided by \nthe state government agencies. The data available for each basin includes committed runoff \nand surplus water available for future planning. The availability of source water was worked \nout by adding the amount of surface water provided for future planning and surplus available. \nThe availability so worked out for the entire basins were then apportioned for the districts in \nthe basin and then again apportioned for the area identified as suitable for recharge \naugmentation. The availability of surplus surface water available for recharge augmentation \nin identified areas for the state as a whole is of the order of 12,455 MCM. \nTable 8.12.1 Scope of Artificial Recharge in Kerala \nS.No District \nArea of \nDistrict \n(Sq.Km.) \nArea \nIdentified for \nAR (Sq.Km.) \nVolume of \nUnsaturated \nZone  \n(MCM) \nAvailable \nSubsurface \nSpace for \nAR (MCM) \nWater \nRequired for \nRecharge \n(MCM) \nSurplus \nAvailable for \nRecharge \n(MCM) \n1 Trivandrum 2192.00 1046.00 4803.00 120.07 160.09 767.00 \n2 Kollam 2491.00 1132.00 3124.00 78.10 104.13 790.00 \n3 Alappuzha 1414.00 137.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n4 Pathanamthitta 2637.00 486.00 914.00 22.85 30.46 627.00 \n5 Kottayam 2208.00 399.00 498.00 14.45 19.27 262.00 \n6 Ernakulam 3068.00 651.00 645.00 19.34 25.78 791.00 \n7 Idukki 4358.00 234.00 182.00 2.73 3.64 336.00 \n8 Thrissur 3032.00 1164.00 2306.00 57.64 76.85 1068.00 \n9 Palakkad 4480.00 858.00 1425.00 21.37 28.50 868.00 \n10 Malappuram 3550.00 1835.00 5690.00 85.35 113.80 1056.00 \nMaster Plan for Artificial Rech",

Surface spreading techniques \nsuch as check dams, percolation ponds, gully plugs and nalah bunds; ground water \nconservation structures such as sub-surface dykes, soil and water conservation methods such \nas contour bunds have been considered as appropriate structures for ground water \naugmentation in the State, depending upon topography and hydrogeological setup. Based on \nthe geomorphological and hydrogeological settings, the feasibility of artificial recharge through \ndifferent structures has been assessed. The number of structures of each category required \nto facilitate the recharge in each district has been computed accordingly. The net number of \nrecharge structures in the state has been finalized based on NAQUIM studies wherever \naquifer mapping is completed.  About 50% of the districts in the state has been mapped under \nNAQUIM and the number of artificial recharge structures feasible in these districts has been \narrived at by utilizing the  optimum number of structures suggested as outcome of the study. \nAs per the data on water conservation activities provided by vari",
    "es feasible in these districts has been \narrived at by utilizing the  optimum number of structures suggested as outcome of the study. \nAs per the data on water conservation activities provided by various agencies such as \nMGNREGA, Rural Development Board, Ground Water Department, Soil Conservation \ndepartment etc, about 1.2cr artificial recharge structures of different types have already been \nconstructed in various parts of state after 2013. The existing artificial recharge structures \ninclude check dams, contour bund, earthern bund, farm ponds, gully plug, percolation pond, \nrain pits, dug well recharge and roof top rain water harvesting. \n \nThus, taking into consideration of the existing structures, the final figure has been arrived by \napportioning the number of structures to the standard unit volume/ capacity as per earlier \nstudies of CGWB and is found to the tune of 3.3 lakh number of structures. Similarly, figures \nare arrived and projected in a similar manner to the remaining districts considering the \ngeomorphology and hydrogeological set up.  In view of the pattern of historica l rainfall in \nKerala, the structures proposed are expected to have 3 fillings a year and the total quantum \nof water recharged through each type of structure has been computed accordingly.

Continued extraction of groundwater for various \nuses from these aquifers over the last several years has resulted in the decline of piezometric \nheads. Augmentation of recharge into these aquifers through suitable techniques will help to \nbring up the piezometric heads in these aquifers and in sustainable development of these \naquifers (CGWB, 2013).  \nBased on the studies carried out by CGWB elsewhere in the country, injection wells for \nrecharging surface runoff has been considered as the most suitable structures for artificial \nrecharge of these aquifers. However, quantification of surface runoff required for recharge has \nnot been computed for want of detailed information pertaining to the intake capacities of these \naquifers and long -term decline of piezometric heads in the aquifers. In view of this, it is \nproposed to implement schemes for recharge augmentation of the deeper sedimentary \naquifers in Alappuzha and Kollam districts on pilot basis.

    "recharge augmentation of the deeper sedimentary \naquifers in Alappuzha and Kollam districts on pilot basis. Injection wells can be constructed to \na depth of 200 and 100m in specific location on pilot basis to check the extent of success. \nBased on the impact of pilot scheme, more recharge structures can be constructed. \n \n8.12.6 Rooftop Rain Water and Runoff Harvesting In Urban Areas \n Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting \nThere are 6 Corporations, 87 Municipal towns and 1 township in the State of Kerala. The total \nurban land area is 3640 sq.km with 15 lakh houses supporting population of 63 lakhs (Census, \n2011). After excluding the area suitable for implementation of artificial recharge, the remaining \n2360 sq.km with 9.75 lakh houses can be considered for roof top rain water harvesting (RWH). \nSince there are limitations to implement roof top rain harvesting in all houses due to \ngeomorphological and hydrogeological setup, increase in vertical expansion, and constraints \nin lateral expansion of buildings in recent years, 50% of the available roof top area has been \nconsidered as suitable for rooftop rain water harvesting for storage. It figures out to be 4.8 lakh \nhouses with population of 20 lakhs, 500 government buildings and around 50 commercial \nbuildings with roof area more than 1000 sq.m.  \nThe annual rainfall in urban area varies from 2267 mm to 3428 mm with an average annual \nrainfall of 3000 mm. After accounting for potential-evapotranspiration, precipitation of the order \nof about 1755 mm is available for conservation. It is estimated that a quantum of 57 MCM of \nrain water can be harvested from 4.8 lakh residential houses with an average roof area of 85 \nsq.m, which can be effectively utilized for storage through suitable roof top rainwater \nharvesting structures by considering 80% efficiency of the system.

Based \non the land availability the size of the storage tanks can be increased up to 4m3. The average \nexpenditure for providing necessary arrangements such as gutters, pipes along with storage \ntank for residential houses have been assessed as Rs. 15,000/ - per unit and thus the total \ncost comes about Rs. 724.18 crores (Table. 8.14.2).  \nIn the case of commercia l buildings, limitations such as non -availability of space and fiscal \nconstraints for construction of huge storage tanks are very significant. The potential was \ncomputed for 50 commercial buildings that come to a tune of 0.07 MCM.  As the minimum per-\ncapita requirement exists under flushing category (15 -20 lpcd), this potential may be utilized \nfor flushing throughout the year by constructing a storage tank of 100m 3.  In the case of \ncommercial buildings, the cost involved for construction and installation of  rain water \nharvesting system (Rs. 30/ - per litre) will be Rs. 30.0 lakhs.  To validate the feasibility and \npotential benefits, a pilot project, with 10 government buildings can be selected to implement \nand the total cost is Rs. 3.0 crore. The water requirement for about 500 government buildings \nand schools at the rate of 1000 to 2000 liters per day is around is 274 m3. Presently, majority \nof these buildings harness rain water under various schemes and average unit cost for \nconservation structure is 0.5 lak h for a building with roof area 100 sq.m.with recharge pit \ncapacity ranging from 10m3 to 20m3 (GWD, Govt. of Kerala).  \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n91 \n \n \nThus, the total cost for the roof top rain water harvesting in the state has been estimated to be \nRs. 724.18Crores in the first phase.

The volume unsaturated sub surface zone is estimated by \nmultiplying the thickness and the area and is of the order of 758453 MCM. The volume \navailable for artificial recharge is given by the product of unsaturate d zone and specific yield \nand is of the order of 24957 MCM. Considering an efficiency of 75% of these artificial recharge \nstructures, water required for artificial recharge works out to be 33193 MCM (Table .8.13.1). \n8.13.3 Source Water Availability for Artificial Recharge  \nThe rainfall received during southwest monsoon between June and September is the principal \nsource of water in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The surface water resources have been \ncalculated block wise by considering Strange’s Table. Out of 81500 MCM, 56000 MCM is \nallocated for Madhya Pradesh and remaining 27000 MCM is allocated to neighboring states \nby virtue of different interstate agreements ( www.mpwrd.gov.in). 44064 MCM available \nsurface water, is committed to Major, Medium and Minor projects, leaving a balance of non -\ncommitted runoff is 11936 MCM.  In some of the blocks the non-committed runoff is more than \nthe water requirement, whereas, in other blocks it is less than requirement.

In hard rock areas \nthe surface spreading techniques consisting of percolation tanks and Check dams/cement \nplugs/nala bunds along with recharge shafts are most appropriate.  In alluvial areas the \npercolation tanks in mountain fronts are most suitable. Recha rge shaft in check dam will \nfacilitate direct recharge to the ground water.  Accordingly, these structures have been \nrecommended for artificial recharge.Other structures like contour trenches and gabion \nstructure etc. may also be taken up side-by-side, which would be more appropriate for soil and \nmoisture conservation. The underground Bhandaras or sub surface dykes are ground water \nconservation structures and hence may be taken up at site specific location to conserve the \nground water at technically suitable locations.The storage capacity of recharge structure was \nworked out based on the findings of various artificial recharge studies under taken in Madhya \nPradesh.

There are 40959 inhabited villages and 2706 un -inhabited villages. As per 2011 \ncensus, the population of Maharashtra state is 112.37 million and is ranked 2nd by population \nand 3rd in terms of area. The State is highly urbanised with 45.2 per cent population living in \ntowns. The State experiences south west monsoon with rainfall ranging from 6000 mm in \nWestern Ghats to less than 500 mm in Madhya Maharashtra. The eastern part of Maharashtra, \nknown as Vidharba Region, receives rainfall up to 1500 mm. Maharashtra falls in four major \nbasins, viz., Godavari  (49%), Krishna (22.6%), Tapi -Purna (16.7%) and west flowing sma ll \nrivers known as Coastal river basin.

    "Krishna (22.6%), Tapi -Purna (16.7%) and west flowing sma ll \nrivers known as Coastal river basin. These basins represent varied hydrogeological, \nmeteorological and agroclimatic features.  \nThe geology of Maharashtra is famous for the Deccan Traps, which occur in all the districts of \nthe State, except Bhandara, Gon dia and Gadchiroli.  The other geological formations, older \nand younger than Deccan Traps, occur in the northeast and as isolated patches in the \nSindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts. The Deccan Trap occupies nearly 82 % area of the State, \nwhereas other hard rocks area occupy around 10% and remaining 8% of the area is occupied \nby soft rock and alluvium in the state.  The plan for artificial recharge is prepared considering \nthe hydrogeological parameters and hydrological data base.   \n \n8.14.1 Identification of Area \nThe area for artificial recharge was identified based on long term decadal (2009 -18) post \nmonsoon (November) depth to water levels, long term post monsoon decadal water level trend \n(2009-18), OCS areas (2017), aquifer type, sub -regional issues etc. An area of 1,23,884 \nSq.Km. had been identified for artificial recharge in parts of 267 blocks of 32 districts of \nMaharashtra State out of the total 36 districts and 355 talukas in the State. In 2 districts i.e., \nRaigarh and Thane, there is no scope for artificial recharge as per above criterions, whereas \n2 districts i.e., Mumbai and Mumbai sub -urban being completely urban districts artificial \nrecharge structures are not feasible. However, in urban areas of all these 4 districts, RTRWH \nand Runoff Rainwater Harvesting has been proposed. The areas feasible for artificial recharge \nare shown in Fig.8.14.1.  \n8.14.2 Sub-Surface Storage and Water Requirement \nThe thickness of available unsaturated zone (below 3 m bgl) is estimated by considering the \nmean water levels in the taluka/block below 3 mbgl. \nThe total volume of unsaturated strata is calculated as 330024.51 MCM in hard rock areas",
    "ted zone (below 3 m bgl) is estimated by considering the \nmean water levels in the taluka/block below 3 mbgl. \nThe total volume of unsaturated strata is calculated as 330024.51 MCM in hard rock areas \nand 103629.54 MCM in soft rock areas. This volume was then multiplied by aquifer wise \nspecific yields to arrive at water required for artificial recharge. Thus, the sub-surface storage \npotential / water required for artificial recharge in hard rock areas was estimated at 6563.08 \nMCM of and 7058.15 MCM in soft rock areas, totaling 13621.23 MCM of water requirement.  \nHowever, based on the e xperiences gained in the field experiments, an average recharge \nefficiency of 75% can be achieved by the individual structure. Thus 18081.09 MCM is required \nas source water to bring water level up to 3m bgl (Table. 8.14.1). \n  \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n99 \n \nTable 8.14.1 Scope of Artificial Recharge in Maharashtra \nS.No District \nArea of \nDistrict \n(Sq.Km.) \nArea \nIdentified \nfor AR \n(Sq.Km.) \nVolume of \nUnsaturated \nZone  \n(MCM) \nAvailable \nSubsurface \nSpace for \nAR (MCM) \nWater \nRequired \nfor \nRecharge \n(MCM) \nSurplus \nAvailable \nfor \nRecharge \n(MCM) \n1 Ahmadnagar 17048 11349 43134 863 1150 262 \n2 Akola 5421 3004 19909 1241 1655 31 \n3 Amravati 12210 5661 19954 943 1258 81 \n4 Aurangabad 10107 5269 20296 406 541 110 \n5 Beed 10693 8261 26135 523 697 187 \n6 Bhandara 4087 1170 3558 172 229 26 \n7 Buldana 9661 6881 25228 1145 1527 104 \n8 Chandrapur 11443 2614 4032 112 150 58 \n9 Dhule 7195 4715 12226 502 670 49 \n10 Gadchiroli 14412 190 168 3 3 4 \n11 Gondia 5234 356 357 5 7 903 \n12 Hingoli 4827 3254 11310 226 302 73 \n13 Jalgaon 11765 6757 45560 2744 3659 70 \n14 Jalna 7718 3727 13650 273 364 83 \n15 Kolhapur 7685 380 456 9 12 9 \n16 Latur 7157 3286 12570 251 335 73 \n17 Mumbai 69 Not \nFeasible \n- - - - \n18 Mumbai \n(Suburban) \n534 Not \nFeasible \n- - - - \n19 Nagpur 9892 4900 16245 334 445 110 \n20 Nanded 10528 3149 9657 193 258",

The data available for each sub basin \nincluded committed runoff, reserved for future planning and surplus water available. \nIn order to account for the requirement of identified area, taluka wise apportioning of  surface \nwater availability was done from Sub basin.  A total of 12308 MCM run off/surface water is \navailable in the State and can be utilized for artificial recharge, however after proportioning it \nfor the target area of 123884 sq. km, the surface water a vailability comes out to be 3871.98 \nMCM. Invariably the proportionate surface water availability is less (3871.98 MCM) and the \nstorage volume or requirement of surface water for AR is more (13621.23 MCM). However, in \ncoastal districts of Maharashtra and Gadchiroli, Dhule, Nandurbar districts, the availability of \nsource water is more and the requirement for artificial recharge is less due to sh",
    "MCM). However, in \ncoastal districts of Maharashtra and Gadchiroli, Dhule, Nandurbar districts, the availability of \nsource water is more and the requirement for artificial recharge is less due to shallow ground \nwater level conditions. Further, only 75% of the surface water available was considered as \navailable for artificial recharge since the entire surface runoff availability cannot be considered \nas many un -planned recharge activities through NGO’s and other private organisations are \nalso taken -up. Thus the proportionate surface water availability for artificial  recharge is \n2060.52 MCM for the State (Hard rock areas -1921.43 MCM and Soft rock/Alluvial areas -\n139.09 MCM). \n \nFig 8.14.2. Areas Identified for Artificial Recharge \n \n8.14.4 Recharge Structures and Cost Estimates \nThe areas have been broadly grouped into hard rock and alluvial areas. In hard rock areas i.e. \nGodavari, Krishna, Coastal basins and part of Tapi-Purna, the surface spreading techniques \nconsisting of percolation tanks and cement plugs/bunds are most appropriate. In alluvial areas \ni.e. part of Tapi and Purna basins, the percolation tanks in mountain fronts and recharge shaft \nin alluvial/bazada zone are the most feasible structures. Accordingly, these structures have \nbeen recommended for artificial recharge. The storage capacity for different structu res \n\n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n101 \n \nconsidering multiple fillings is worked out as 200 TCM (100 TCM for single filling) for \npercolation tanks, 30TCM (10 TCM for single filling) for check dams and 60 TCM (1 \nTCM/day*60 days) for recharge shafts. Other structures like contour trenches, gabi on \nstructure, nala bunds, village ponds etc. may also be taken up side by side which would be \nmore appropriate for soil and moisture conservation.

    "ich would be \nmore appropriate for soil and moisture conservation. Besides these, many site specific popular \npractices are being adopted by state govt. which can also be taken depending upon local \nhydrogeological settings in lieu of proposed percolation tanks and check dams. The under -\nground bandharas or sub surface dykes & KT Weirs are ground/surface water conservation \nstructures and hence can be taken up at site specific location to conserve the ground water. \nThe amount of surface water considered for planning the artificial recharge is 2060.52 MCM. \nBased on the field situation it has been considered that 70% storage would be through \npercolation tanks and remaining by check dams (Hard rock areas) or recharge shafts (Alluvial \nareas). Accordingly 1436.38 MCM (70%) will be stored in percolation tanks, 577.12 MCM will \nbe stored in Cement plugs/check dams and 46.93 MCM through recharge shafts. Therefore, \n7188 percolation tanks, 19243  check dams/cement plugs and 838 recharge shafts are \nproposed in the identified areas of Maharashtra.

    "d urban pockets where land availability for \nconstruction of tanks/reservoirs etc. is almost non-existent and quality of surface water is very \npoor due to domestic pollution. As per 2011 census there are 537 urban towns with \n1,12,93,543 households in 36 districts of the State. In the absence of data on the exact size \nof each individual house, an average roof size of 50 sq.m has been considered and further, \ndue to various losses, 80% of the volume of rainwater from the roof is co nsidered for \nharvesting. Considering a roof area of area of 564.68 sq.m and an average annual rainfall for \nthe period 2009-18, total harnessable rainwater from roof area works out to be 917.87 MCM. \nIn the areas of shallow water table, the harnessed water c an be used to augment the water \nsupply instead of using for recharge. In the proposed plan the households having dugwell or \nborewell etc, which is about 50% (56,46,772) are targeted for recharging the harnessed water \nfrom roof top. An average cost for prov iding the necessary arrangements, for recharge into \nexisting wells shall be around Rs. 30,000/- per house. The estimated total cost comes out to \nbe Rs. 16940.31 crores for covering all the 537 urban towns (Table 8.14.4). Since only 50% \nof the households ar e considered for RTRWH, the rainwater available on roof tops will be \n458.935 MCM. The above quantity of rainwater is received at rooftop but same is not available \ndown the roof due to various losses in the form of moisture absorption, evaporation losses \nand leakage etc. Therefore 80% of the above figure i.e., 367.148 MCM is considered available \nfor harvesting the rainwater which will be taken as source for artificial recharge to ground \nwater. The recharge efficiency of the structures is considered 75%, th us ultimate recharge \npotential available by RTRWH is about 275.361 MCM. It is estimated that about 226 lakh \nadditional urban population would get adequate water supply round the year by implementing \nthis scheme.",
    "arge \npotential available by RTRWH is about 275.361 MCM. It is estimated that about 226 lakh \nadditional urban population would get adequate water supply round the year by implementing \nthis scheme. \nRunoff Water Harvesting \nThe rainfall runoff flowing from the roads and open grounds is substantial during rains, which \nultimately flows out of the city unutilized. This water if conserved and utilized properly for \nrecharging the ground water reservoir may bring much needed relief t o the water scarcity \nareas of the city. A scheme suitable for artificial recharge in urban area was prepared by \nC.G.W.B and was successfully implemented and operated at Nagpur Municipal Corporation \nground. In this scheme about 15000 sq.m of residential catchment was intercepted and runoff \ngenerated was diverted into the specially constructed recharge well in the public garden. The \nrunoff water was filtered silt free by providing a filter pit. Number of such locations can be \nidentified within city areas where such structure may be constructed to provide a sustainable \nground water based water supply in the city. \nIt is estimated that in 537 urban areas of Maharashtra around 8995 schemes would be needed \nwith an average of 15 schemes per town/city, except Mumbai and Mumbai Sub-urban where \n100 schemes each are proposed considering its dense urban set-up and vast areas, whereas \nin other 24 major cities/town coming under Municipal Corporations like Navi Mumbai, Thane, \nKalyan-Dombivali, Vasai-Virar, Pune, PCMC, Nashik , Aurangabad, Nagpur etc 50 schemes \neach are proposed. The cost estimate of these schemes would work out to be Rs 674.63 cr at \nunit cost of Rs 7.5 lakh. It is estimated that about 9 lakh additional urban population would get \nadequate water supply round the year by implementing this scheme. \n8.14.6 Total Cost \nThe total cost estimate for artificial recharge in Maharashtra is Rs 30834.06Cr with a break up \nof Rs 13893.74 Cr for rural areas & Rs 16940.31 Cr for urban areas",

It spreads over a geographical area of 1,55,707 \nsq. km.The state comprises of 3 revenue divisions having 30 districts.The total population of \nOrissa is 4,19,74,218 as per census report of 2011 and largely depends on agriculture. \nThere are eleven principal rivers traversing the entire state that can be grouped under eight \nmajor river basins within the state. Most of the major rivers flow in easterly and south-easterly \ndirections with gentle gradient. The normal annual rainfall of the state is 1451mm with average \nannual rainy days of 74.The rainfall is highest in the northern part of the coasta l tract and \nreduces westward. The low rainfall area stretches from Keonjhar on the north to Gopalpur in \nthe south through Angul and Phulbani district. \nGeological setting, climate and topography plays important role in the occurrence and \nmovement of groundwater. The state can be broadly divided into three distinct units,based on \nhydrogeology. \nArea with Precambrian consolidated formations: The consolidated formations include the \nhard crystalline and metamorphosed compact sedimentary formations belonging to \nPrecambrian era and occupies nearly 80% of the total geographical area of the state. The \ngroundwater occurs in secondary porosity resulting from weathering, fracturing and jointing. \nThe weathered mantle is composed of loose regolith with intergranular porosi ty, which \nfacilitates free circulation of groundwater through deeper fractures and forms potential \nrepository of groundwater. In general the avera",
    "omposed of loose regolith with intergranular porosi ty, which \nfacilitates free circulation of groundwater through deeper fractures and forms potential \nrepository of groundwater. In general the average thickness of weathered residuum varies \nfrom 15 to 20m. The groundwater occurs under water table conditions.  The water bearing \nfracture zones generally occur within 100 meters of depth. \nArea with semi -consolidated Gondwana & Tertiary formation: The semi -consolidated \nformations include Gondwana Sedimentaries ranging in age from Upper Carboniferous to \nCretaceous and the Baripada beds of Middle -Pliocene age. The coarse to medium grained, \nweathered, fractured and friable Gondwana sandstones and the semi-consolidated sand beds \nof Baripada Formation form the aquifers. The groundwater occurs under water table conditions \nin the near surface aquifers and under confined conditions in the deeper aquifers. The depth \nof weathering in Gondwanas generally extends to a depth of 15m. \nArea with unconsolidated Quaternary formations: The unconsolidated sediments include \nPleistocene and Recent alluvium. The older alluvium is generally overlain by laterites, which \nforms a conspicuous and significant horizon. The laterites are vesicular essentially ferruginous \nand form good repository of groundwater. Maximum development of alluvial formations occurs \nalong the coastal tract, exceeding 600m of thickness. Alluvium also occurs as discontinuous \npatches adjoining the river courses, where the thickness is limited to 45m. The sand and gravel \nlayers act as repository of groundwater. The coastal tr act holds potential for large scale \ngroundwater development as the sand zones form prolific aquifers. But, the coastal tract is \nbeset with salinity problems both in shallow as well as deeper aquifers at different locales. \nThe electrical conductivity (EC) o f ground water is generally below 1000 S/cm at 25°C in \naround 90% of the area of the State. EC value more than 2000 S/cm is ob",
    "per aquifers at different locales. \nThe electrical conductivity (EC) o f ground water is generally below 1000 S/cm at 25°C in \naround 90% of the area of the State. EC value more than 2000 S/cm is observed mostly in \ncoastal districts of the State. High EC value, which is an indicator of salinity of water has been \nobserved in Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Balasore and Ganjam districts. Apart from \nthe coastal districts, small pockets in Bargarh, Balangir and Kalahandi districts also show \nhigher value of EC in groundwater. \nThe groundwater quality in shallow wells has got a marked difference in hard rock area and in \ncoastal area. The chloride value is generally below 50 mg/L in the State. The low values of \nchloride have been observed in the hard rock area, as compared to the coastal area. The high \nvalues of chloride in coasta l Odisha may be due to upconing of saline water existing \nunderneath fresh water or due to sea water ingression. \n8.15.1 Identification of Areas \nThe areas suitable for artificial recharge is identified based on the following information: \nAreas showing post monsoon depth to water level (2018) more than 5m  \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n106 \n \n \nAreas showing declining decadal water level trend (2009-2018) more than 10 cm/year \nAreas showing EC more than 2000 µS/cm at 25oC \n \nAll these three maps are superimposed and the area common in these three maps has been \nidentified as the area identified for artificial recharge.

The thickness of available unsaturated zone (below 3 mbgl) is \nestimated by consi dering the different ranges of water level. The different ranges of DTW \n(depth to water level) are averaged to arrive at thickness of unsaturated zone. The volume of \ndesaturated sub surface space up to 3m bgl is given by the product of area and the thickness. \nThe volume of space available for artificial recharge is estimated by the product of volume of \ndesaturated sub surface and respective specific yield of the formation. The estimated volume \nof sub surface space available for recharge is 669 MCM. Based on  the experience gained in \nthe pilot/demonstrative recharge projects implemented in different hydrogeological situations, \nan average recharge efficiency of 75% of the individual structure is considered. Thus the \nvolume of water required for recharge is 890 MCM.

In all the districts, the available surplus run off is found to be more than \nthe water required for artificial recharge. \n \n8.15.4 Recharge Structures and Cost Estimates \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n108 \n \n \nThe physiography, hydrogeology and hydrology of an area play important role in deciding the \ntype of recharge structures feasible in an area. Accordingly, allocation of various st ructures \nhas been made for various district and furnished as Table 8.15.2. The numbers of structures \nhave been worked out based on the gross capacity with multiple fillings, viz., 200 TCM for \npercolation tank, 150 TCM for Nala bund/contour bunding/check dam.  \n \n In urban areas of the state due to higher concentration of population and allied activities the \nextraction of ground water is observed to be higher as compared to rural areas. Further due \nto construction activities in these urban areas open areas available has also reduced resulting \nin decrease in natural recharge. Hence, apart from above recharge structures, it is proposed \ntohave roof top rainwater harvesting in 15700 school and college buildings in urban areas of \nallthe districts in the State. The district wise proposed number of roof top rainwater harvesting \nstructures is given in table 8.15.2. \n \n8.15.5 Total Cost \nThe total cost estimate for artificial recharge in Odisha is Rs 801.65 Cr with a break up of Rs \n597.55 Cr for rural areas & Rs 204.10 Cr for urban areas through Rooftop rainwater harvesting \n.\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (",

Upper Bari- Doab area \nreveals the presence of 4 to 5 thick permeable granular zones to a depth of 300 m having \nthree-aquifer groups in depth range of 9 to 138mbgl, 106 to 264m bgl and 197 to 300mbgl. In \nBist Doab Area, the aquifers comprise sand and silt with intercalation of little clay and \nkankarhaving in depth range of 15to 130mbgl, 128to 225m bg l and 234 to 300mbgl.

    "s South and aquifers become thinner and quality of ground water \nalso deteriorates. In South western districts of the state, aquifers are interbedded with clay \nlayers below 30 m depth, clay invariably forms the major portion of alluvium. Aquifers in these \ndistricts, particularly in the saline areas, are mostly thin and pinch out at short distances, thus \nrestricting the movement of ground water. In rest of the districts of the state, the aquifers are \nextensive in nature and are separated by 8-10 m thick clay beds. Aquifer -I extends maximum \ndown to 111 m of depth followed by persistent clay layer separating Aquifer II at the depth of \n128-195 m and another clay layer separates Aquifer-III down to 300m depth. \n8.16.1 Identification of Area \nBased on the post monsoon depth to water level of the year 2018 and long term (2009 -18) \nground water level trends, it has been estimated that approximately 45,592 sq. kms area is \nfeasible for artificial recharge(Fig 8.16.1). The  area feasible for artificial recharge to ground \nwater is demarcated based on criteria of depth to water level of more than 3 m bgl during post-\nmonsoon season and continuous annual decline rate of more than 10 cm per annum.   \n8.16.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nThe total volume of unsaturated strata is calculated by considering unsaturated thickness of \naquifers on block-wise basis. The sub-surface storage potential is estimated by multiplying the \nvolume of unsaturated aquifer by average specific yield (12%). Sub surface storage potential \nof the state is estimated as 86,789MCM during post -monsoon season of 2018. The quantity \nof water required to saturate the storage is estimated by multiplying the sub -surface storage \npotential with 1.33 fac tors. The quantity of water required for filling the sub -surface storage \npotential (unsaturated zone) is approximately 115430 MCM (Table 8.16.1). \n8.16.3 Source Water Availability \nThe quantity of non -committed surface water in the",
    "ed for filling the sub -surface storage \npotential (unsaturated zone) is approximately 115430 MCM (Table 8.16.1). \n8.16.3 Source Water Availability \nThe quantity of non -committed surface water in the Punjab state has been esti mated to be \nonly 1200.99 MCM (as per the data available from the state government). The surplus canal \nwater available for recharge for each district has also been provided by State Government. In \naddition, it is proposed to harvest run off from agricultural land, which may be retained in the \nagricultural land in local depressions etc. This has been computed as run off only from 10% \nof the agricultural landwith a run off coefficient of 15%.

It is situated in the North -\nwestern part of India and shares its border with Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya \nPradesh, and Gujarat States. The western b order is shared with Pakistan. It has a total \ngeographic area of 3,42,239 sq km. and situated between 23° 03'to 30° 12' North latitudes \nand 69° 30' to 78° 17' East longitudes. The State is divided into 33 districts and 295 blocks . \nAs per Census 2011, Rajasthan State has population of 6,85,48,437with population density of \n200 persons per sq kmspread over 9892 Gram Panchayats and 45884 villages.   \nThere are 14 river basins in the State, viz., Shekhawati, Banganga, Sabi (Sahibi), Banas, West \nBanas, Chambal, Luni, Sukli, Mahi, Ruparail, Gambhir, Parbati, Sabarmati& other nallahs of \nJalore, which cover eastern, northern and southern river catchments. Aravallis form major \ndrainage divide with majority of rivers originating from it flowing towards east and very few  \nflowing towards west. Luni is the only river, in West of Aravalli whereas remaining Western \nRajasthan has internal drainage which dies out in the desert sand after flowing for limited \ndistance.   \nRainfall is the major source of ground water recharge in th e state. The state receives 90% \nrainfall from southwest monsoon from June to September. The winter rainfall is meagre. The \ndecadal average annual rainfall of the state (2009-18) is 542.7 mm. The state can be divided \ninto four units , viz., (a) Aravalli hill  ranges (b) Eastern plains (c) Western Sandy Plain and \nSand Dunes and (d) VindhyanScarpland and Deccan Lava Plateau.  \nThe Aravalli ranges trending NE -SW are the oldest mountain chain in India.

The south-eastern plains are locally characterized by plateau, scarp land and \nravines. The sandy plains in western Rajasthan, forming a part of Thar Desert, are mainly \noccupied by alluvium and blown sand s. The VindhyanScarpland is seen all along the Great \nBoundary Fault from Chittorgarh to the trijunction of Bharatpur, Dholpur and SawaiMadhopur \ndistricts. The Deccan Lava Plateau is mainly confined to parts of Kota, Jhalawar, Banswara \nand Chittorgarh distr icts. The ravines, locally impassable, are confined to the alluvium \noverlying the Vindhyans in Dholpur, SawaìMadhopur, Jhalawar and Kota districts along the \nChambal River and its tributaries. \nThe structures are proposed keeping in view the traditional practices, successful case studies \nof previous works, social adaptability, forest cover, favourable land use etc. The master plan \nhas been prepared using data of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Ground Water \nDepartment (GWD), Watershed Development & Soil Conservation (WD&SC) and input of JAL \nShakti Abhiyan (JSA) etc.  \n8.17.1 Identification of Area \nRajasthan State has been divided by Aravalli ranges. Western part is characterized by arid to \nsemi-arid climatic conditions with normal rainfall of less than 500 mm  whereas eastern part \nhas sub-humid to humid climate with normal rainfall ranging from more than 500 to 1070mm. \nin addition to the ground water exploitation, the criteria of the areas with post monsoon water \nlevel between 3 & 9m bgl, 9 & 20mbgl and more th an 20mbgl, with post monsoon long term \nwater level showing declining trend between 0.2m/yr& 0.5 m/yr and more than 0.5m/yr and \nwith EC less than2500 µS/cm at 250C have been considered for the identification of areas for \nartificial recharge (Fig 8.17.1). \n8.17.2 Subsurface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nThe subsurface storage space available for artifici",

The details are given below: \nEastern Rajasthan covers 23 districts, viz., Ajmer, Alwar, Banswara, Baran, Bharatpur, \nBhilwara, Bundi, Chittaurgarh, Dausa, Dholpur, Dungarpur, Jaipur, Jalore, Jhalawar, Karauli, \nKota, Pali, Pratapgarh, Rajsamand, Sawai Madhopur, Sirohi, Tonk& Udaipur.

In these desert \npart of the State, it has been found that artificial recharge practically not feasible under the \nprevailing circumstances.

    "es. Hence, it is proposed to promote rain water harvesting through \nstorage structures like Tankas.  \nThere is localized drainage available in the area where sandstone, limestone and other rocks \nare exposed creating runoff during monsoon. The pond (talab) with recharge borewell are \nproposed to conserve rain water and for recharging the aquifers for sustainable ground water \nutilization. The quantification of such ponds will depend on availability of site specific data and \ncase to case basis.  The district -wise detailof number of various interventions of \nconservation/recharge structures proposed in the State along with cost estimate is given in \nTable-8.17.2.  \nThe cost estimates of the rain water harvesting and aquifer recharge structures are taken from \nthe Watershed Development and Soil Conservation Department of the State, which is based \non the implementation of Mukhyamantri Jal Swablamban Abhiyan (MJSA)in Rajasthan under \nvarious phases of MGNAREGA activities. Accordingly, total cost of rain water harvesting and \naquifer recharge schemes in Eastern (Non-desert) and Western (Desert) districts of the State \nwould be Rs. 19,318.10 Crores.  \nRoof Top Rain Water Harvesting In Urban Areas \nWatershed and Soil Conservation Department of Govt. of Rajasthan has prepared a plan for \ncreation of roof top rain water harvesting in urban areas under National Water C onservation \nScheme (Jal Jeevan Mission-Varsha Jal DharaKe Tal) of Ministry of Jal Shakti, Govt of India. \nThe scheme shall be Central Sponsored Scheme (CSS) with sharing pattern of funds between \nCentre and State in the ratio of 60:40. Around 20% of househol ds shall be identified for \ndisbursing the benefits of this scheme for construction of roof top rain water system.  \nThe capacity of rain water harvesting system shall depend on roof top of individual household, \nconsidering roof and paved area of 200 sqm of each household, normal rainfall of the State \nand 80 % efficiency of the system, it is presumed t",

The Govt. buildings, institutes etc. in urban and municipal \nareas of the state may be taken up for artificial recharge in priority/phase wise manner.  \nThe total cost of the harvesting works proposed under the National Water Conservation \nScheme by the WD&SC Department would be Rs, 1,440 Cr., considering an average unit cost \nof structure Rs, 150 00/- as fixed in the scheme. The recharge plan under National Water \nConservation Scheme has already been submitted to the Govt. of India by the WD&SC \ndepartment of Govt. of Rajasthan. The details are given below:  \nTotal nos. of households in urban areas: 48,00,000 Nos.  \nTotal nos. of harvesting works proposed for 20% of households: 9,60,000 Nos.  \nTotal cost of harvesting works proposed under the scheme: Rs. 1,440 Crores \n \nHence, rooftop rainwater harvesting has not been included for the State of Rajasthan and \nthus the total cost estimate for artificial recharge in Rajasthan for rural areas works out to \nbe 19,318.10 Crores. \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n123 \n \n \n8.18 SIKKIM \nSikkim State occupies a total geographical area of 7,096 sq km with four districts, viz.

    "iods (January to April) especially in the rain shadow \nareas falling in parts of South, West and East districts. \n \nAlthough so far there is negligible ground water development in the State of Sikkim, still there \nis scope for:  (a) water conservation in the Spring sheds, where the terrain slope is within 50, \nso that ground water is recharged through construction of contour trenches/staggered \ntrenches, slope terracing, cement plug/subsurface dykes to obtain sustainable yield from the \nsprings. (b) Augmenting artificial recharge in the hillslopes to rejuvenate springs in downslopes \nthrough renovation of old lakes/ponds or excavation of new ponds in suitable geomorphic \nlocales (c) Augmenting artificial recharge in the hillslo pes through irrigation in the terraced \npaddy field diverting perennial flow along slope through check dam cum diversion weir  and \nconveyance  drain/pipes (d) Further to augment the water availability in such sloping terrain \nreceive high rainfall, there is vast scope for roof top rainwater harvesting as also harvesting of \nrainwater in landscapes through wrapping permeable membrane (Polythene sheets) in the dig \nout ponds and through harvesting perennial surface flow along slopes and surplus monsoon \nrainfall  through streams by means of check dam where the terrain slope is within 30-40. The \nState is dotted with good number of springs which are mainly controlled by geological \nstructures and topography. From the study by CGWB it is observed that all the spring u nder \nuse for rural drinking water supply are located within 50% terrain slope. These springs can be \ndeveloped and rejuvenated for providing sustainable water supply to the rural population.

The State of Tamil Nadu, along with the \nenclaves constituting the Union Territory of Pondicherry is characterized by diverse climatic, \nphysiographic, and hydrogeological conditions.  The state receives rainfall during south west \nmonsoon (June – October) & northeast monsoon (November – December) and the normal \nannual rainfall is of the order of 1008.1 mm (1951 - 2018).  The contribution from south west \nmonsoon is of the order of 525.1 mm (52%), while the contribution from north east monsoon  \nis of the order of 28% and non monsoon rainfall (January – May) is of the order of 200.5 mm \n(20%).  The ground water development scenario of the state is also very complex.  Increasing \ndemand and vagaries of rainfall, coupled with the near -total utilization of available surface \nwater resources have resulted in increasing dependence on ground water which has become \nthe major source for domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors.  Development of ground \nwater has already reached a critical stage in many pa rts of the state.  Over exploitation of \nground water in more than 50% of the geographical area has resulted in declining ground \nwater levels, shortage in water supply, deepening of pumping levels and consequent increase \nin power consumption. \nThe increased ground water development in pockets for th",
    "sulted in declining ground \nwater levels, shortage in water supply, deepening of pumping levels and consequent increase \nin power consumption. \nThe increased ground water development in pockets for the industrial use has resulted in \nground water mining in such pockets warranting a long term remediation.  The regional ground \nwater development in the sedimentary aquifers of larger areal extent for industrial and \nagricultural activity is in the rise in recent years and the vulnerability of coastal aquifers for sea \nwater ingress is noticed.  \nVarious State Agencies, viz., Agricultural Engineering Department, Public Works Department, \nTamil Nadu Water Supply & Drainage Board and Forest Department have already constructed \nartificial recharge structures under various schemes. Forest Department has constructed \nCheck Dams in the high reaches of Reserved Forest area. In the recent 5 years period, DRDA \nhas constructed large n umber of artificial recharge structures as well as renovated water \nbodies, which are locally called ‘Ooranis’ or ‘Kudis’ and this process of rejuvenation is locally \ncalled as ‘Kudimarammathu’.  So far DRDA desilted and renovated about 40,000 such Ooranis \nunder this scheme of Kudimarammathu in the state which improved not only the storage \ncapacity of water bodies but also groundwater sustainability in the vicinity of those water \nbodies.  In this decade i.e., since 2010 more than a lakh artificial recharge st ructures have \nbeen constructed in the state by different State Government Departments under different \nschemes like MGNREGA.  \nIn spite of these all-out efforts the water levels in many parts of the state are deep and not rise \nto the expected levels.  However, the decadal post monsoon water level trends for the period \nof 2010 -2019 are not showing any significant fall more than 0.1m/year, which may be \nattributed to the augmentation of groundwater from the artificial recharge structures \nconstructed during the preceding decade.  Therefor",
    "howing any significant fall more than 0.1m/year, which may be \nattributed to the augmentation of groundwater from the artificial recharge structures \nconstructed during the preceding decade.  Therefore, it is imperative to increase the density \nof suitable artificial recharge structures across the identified areas of the state in order to \nfurther rise the status of groundwater storage without compromising the current developmental \nlevel. \n8.19.1 Identification of the Area \nThe area characterized by depth to water level more than 4 m during the post monsoon period \n(Jan 2019) coupled with declining decadal long term water level trend (Jan 2010 – Jan 2019) \nof more than 0.1m/yr, is considered as area requiring intervention through artificial recharge. \nIn addition, the localized pockets of intensive agriculture and industrial activity identified by \nstate agencies and select locations of sedimentary aquifers of multi layered aquifer syst em \nrequiring special intervention have also been considered.

(Table 8.19.1) \n8.19.3 Source Water Availability \nThe surface water availability has been computed using improved strange cur ve for each \nwatershed in a project entitled “Identification of Recharge areas Using Remote Sensing and \nGIS in Tamil Nadu, taken up by the Institute of Remote Sensing, Anna University, Chennai \nand sponsored by the Dept. of Rural Development, Govt. of Tamil Nadu and Tamil Nadu Water \nSupply and Drainage Board.

However in the present \nproposals 10 p ercent of the normal rainfall of the development blocks has been taken as \nuncommitted surplus runoff available for artificial recharge, instead of 15 percent of normal \nrainfall.

The state is bordered by the states \nof Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the west and Andhra Pradesh to the \nsouth, east and north -east. The State comprises 33 districts, 584 mandals with 10,434 \nrevenue villages. The total populatio",
    "hhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the west and Andhra Pradesh to the \nsouth, east and north -east. The State comprises 33 districts, 584 mandals with 10,434 \nrevenue villages. The total population of the state is ~3.5 Crores (2011 census), of which 61 \n% lives in rural area and 39% in urban area. The density of population is 312 per Sq. Km. The \ndecadal growth in population is ~13.6 % (2001 to 2011 census).  The state is mainly drained \nby Godavari and Krishna and their tributaries. There are 2 major basins and 13 sub basins in \nthe state. The normal annual rainfall of the state is 909 mm. The annual rainfall in 2018 ranges \nfrom 478 mm in Mahbubnagar district  to 1215 mm in Adilabad district. Major part of the State \nis underlain by gneissic complex with a structural fill of s edimentary formations and basin-fill \nof meta-sedimentary formations.  \n8.20.1 Identification of Area: \nThe area suitable for ground water augmentation through artificial recharge has been \ndemarcated based on the analysis of average post-monsoon depth to water level data of the \nobservation wells for the period of 2009-2018 and the existing data on artificial recharge \nstructures constructed under various schemes of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) and Integrated Watershed Manag ement \nPrograms (IWMP) by Rural Development department, Govt. of Telangana.  Accordingly, an \narea of 42,155.89 sq.kms area spread over in 279 mandals falling in 29 districts is identified \nfor recommendation of artificial recharge structures. The remaining a rea of 52,820 s q.kms \ncomprises of 295 mandals have water level less than 5 m bgl and an area of 1,587 sq.kms \ncomprises in 10 mandals have sufficient number of existing artificial recharge structures \nhence, no scope for taking up artificial recharge.  \n8.20.2 Sub Surface Storage Space \nThe availability of sub-surface storage volume of aquifers in each district is computed as the \nproduct of area, thickness of aquifer zo",
    "ing up artificial recharge.  \n8.20.2 Sub Surface Storage Space \nThe availability of sub-surface storage volume of aquifers in each district is computed as the \nproduct of area, thickness of aquifer zone between 5 m. bgl and the average post -monsoon \nwater level. The sub surface storage volume is estimated as 1,67,141 MCM.  The recharge \npotential/sub surface space of the aquifers is calculated by multiplying the sub surface storage \nvolume with specific yield of the aquifers, which is in the range of 2 -3% (hard rock aquifer \nsystem). The Sub surfa ce space/recharge potential of the aquifers is 3342.82 MCM in the \nState (Table 8.20.2). The water required to recharge the subsurface storage capacity is \n4445.97 MCM, considering 77% efficiency of the recharge structures. \n \n8.20.3 Source Water Availability \nThe source water availability is estimated from the rain fall and run off correlations. The runoff \nwas calculated by taking into account of normal monsoon rainfall of the mandal and \ncorresponding runoff yield from Strangers Table for average catchment type. Out of the total \nrun off available in the mandal, o nly 20% is considered for recommendation of artificial \nrecharge structures  considering the riparian rights and other practical considerations for \nrecommending the artificial recharge structures.  Though the sub surface space/recharge \npotential of the aquifers is 3342.82 MCM, only 1186.48 MCM of surplus run off is available for \nrecharge the aquifers (Table 8.20.2). The storage required for existing 20,610 no. of artificial \nrecharge structures (7,980 check dams and 12,630 percolation tanks) constructed by State \nGovt. departments under different IWMP and MNREGS schemes is deducted to arrive the \nbalance surplus run off availability for recommending the additional feasible artificial recharge \nstructures. \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n133 \n \n \n \nFig 8.20.1: Area Identified for Artificial Rech",

The state is a part Ganga basin comprising of Yamuna, Ram Ganga, Gomti, Ghaghra \nand son sub basins. The alluvial plains and southern rocky terrain are main water bearing \nformations from point of view of ground water availability.  \nThe state of Ut tar Pradesh is categorized with five distinct hydrogeological units – Bhabar, \nTerai, Central Ganga Plains, Marginal Alluvial Plain, Southern Peninsular area. Bhabar is \nmainly the recharge zone having deeper water levels. Ground water development in phreatic \naquifer is through hand pumps, dug wells, dug cum bore wells and sh",
    "ain, Southern Peninsular area. Bhabar is \nmainly the recharge zone having deeper water levels. Ground water development in phreatic \naquifer is through hand pumps, dug wells, dug cum bore wells and shallow tube wells. Terai \nzone lies between Bhabar in the North and Central Ganga Plain in the South. It is \ncharacterized by fine grained sediments with occasional pebbles and boulders. Central Ganga \nPlain constitutes the most promising ground water repository characterized by multi -layered \naquifer systems. Marginal alluvial plain consists of kankar mixed clay -silt beds intercalated \nwith sand and gravel lenses. Southern Peninsular Region is characterized by sedimentary \nformations (sandstone, quartzite, limestone, shale). The artificial recharge in these aquifers \ndepend on the geomorphology & groundwater regime.  \n8.21.1 Identification of Area  \nThe area for artificial recharge in the state has been identified with block as the unit for \nidentification aggregated to districts, for technical and administrative convenience. The criteria \nused for identification of area for artificial recharge are given below.  \nAll the Over-exploited and Critical blocks with post monsoon water level > 5m bgl (Average \npost-monsoon WL, 2018 of individual block).  \nEntire Bundelkhand Region, UP, as well as Mirzapur and Sonbhadra districts, where \nsustainability is an issue, necessitating water conservation. \n‘Semi-critical’ and ‘Safe’ blocks showing water level decline of more than 20 cm/yr (as per \nconsultation with State Government criterion of significant decline considered in the State \nhas been applied) and with water levels deeper than 5 mbgl. \nTotal 276 blocks, falling in 54 districts and covering 97,335 sq.km. area, have been identified \nfor artificial recharge and shown as selected blocks in the Fig 8.21.1. \n8.21.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nThe difference between average depth to water level (2018) in  the block and 5m was \ncalculated to arrive at thick",
    "ed blocks in the Fig 8.21.1. \n8.21.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement \nThe difference between average depth to water level (2018) in  the block and 5m was \ncalculated to arrive at thickness of effective unsaturated zone. The product of area and the \nthickness of unsaturated zone gives the volume of unsaturated zone in the State, which on \nmultiplying with specific yield provides the volume  of unsaturated zone available for artificial \nrecharge. Considering an efficiency of 75% of the artificial recharge structures, volume of \nrequired water for saturating the available unsaturated zone was worked out. The details of \nthe computations are provided as Table 8.21.1.  A perusal of the table shows that for an area \nof 97335 sq.km, volume of space available for recharge works out to be 66971 MCM and the \nwater required for recharge is of the order of 89071 MCM. \n8.21.3 Source Water Availability \nIn the a bsence of precise data on surface water utilization for the State, surface water \navailability has been calculated by considering average monsoon run off of 30% of which 30% \nhas been taken as non-committed water availability (i.e overall 9% of Monsoon Rainfall). The \n30% of monsoon rainfall has been taken considering the erratic and localized rainfall pattern. \nEnsuring sufficient allocation for existing and ongoing surface water conservation projects \n40% of the present non -committed surface water has been con sidered for preparing the \nrecharge plan (i.e net available quantum is 3.6% of Monsoon Rainfall). Total utilizable run-off \nhas been worked out as 2743 MCM against the required 89071 MCM (Table 8.21.1).  \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n139 \n \n \n \nFig 8.21.1 Area identified for Recharge in Uttar Pradesh \n \n \nTable-8.21.1 Scope of Artificial Recharge in Uttar Pradesh \nS.No District \nArea of \nDistrict \n(Sq.Km.) \nArea \nIdentified \nfor AR \n(Sq.Km.) \nVolume of \nUnsaturated \nZone  \n(MCM) \nAvai",

Since, information about \nRoof Top Area is not readily available, certain assumptions have been made. Out of the total \narea, 3% has been taken as Roof Top Area, which comes to ≈183 Sq Km, 15% of which, i.e \n≈27 Sq Km (≈27 million Sqm) has been considered as Roof Top area of Government buildings. \nIt is presumed that 25% Government Buildings already have RTRWH system in place, leaving \n≈20.57 sqm where RTRWH is to be implemented. Cost of RTRWH for 100 Sqm is \napproximately Rupees 1 Lakh. The total cost thus will be Rs 205722 Lakhs (Rupees 2057 \nCrore). Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting proposal is summarized in following table. \n \n8.21.5 Total Cost \nThe total cost of artificial recharge for the State of Uttar Pradesh is of the order of Rs 7156.45 \nCr, out of which, cost estimate for Rural area is of the order of Rs 5099.23 Cr and Urban area \nis 2057.22 Cr. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n142 \n \n \nTable-8.21.2 Artificial Recharge in Uttar Pradesh \n \n   Number of Structures Unit Cost of Structures (Lakh) Cost of Structures (Lakh)   \nS.No District CD/NB/ \nCP \nDW/T\nW/’ \nRS \nPond \nRTRWH \n(Area in \nsq.km) \nPT \nCD/N\nB/ \nCP \nDW/T\nW/ \nRS \nPond \nRTRW\nH (per \n100sq\nm) \nPT CD/NB/ \nCP \nDW/TW\n/ \nRS \nPond RTRWH PT Total Cost \n(Lakh) \n1 Agra 190 190 446 0.6473   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 3800.00 285.00 13380.00 6473.25 0.00 23938.25 \n2 Aligarh 39 39 92 0.4905   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 780.00 58.50 2760.00 4905.23 0.00 8503.73 \n3 Allahabad 97 97 230 0.5468   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 1940.00 145.50 6900.00 5467.50 0.00 14453.00 \n4 Aurraiya 43 43 101 0.1245   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 860.00 64.50 3030.00 1245.38 0.00 5199.88 \n5 Azamgarh 8 8 20 0.2010   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 160.00 12.00 600.00 2010.15 0.00 2782.15 \n6 Baghpat 76 76 179 0.2006   20.0 1.5 30.0 1.0 60.0 1520.00 114.0",

About 85% \nof the area of Uttarakhand state is occupied by the Himalayan Mountain. The Himalayan Mountain \nis represented by NW-SE trending hill ranges, which exhibit highly rugged youthful topography. \nUttarakhand State has a very prominent drainage system varying from first to fourth or fifth order. \nThe main drainage patterns are dendritic, trellis and rectangular. The Ya muna, Ganga, \nRamganga and Sarda rivers drain the area. Each river has numerous tributaries in Uttarakhand \nHimalayas.  \nThe Higher Himalayan range is perennially covered by snow. The area is divided into units like \nHigh relief glaciated area, Structural hill s, Denudational hills, dissected fans, river terraces and \nflood plains. The southern boundary of Foot Hills of Himalayas is covered by Bhabar, Tarai, Doon \nGravels and alluvium. Major part of the hilly area has a slope more than 20%. A slope of the \nmagnitude of this order makes the area unsuitable for groundwater development due to low \ngroundwater potential. In H",

A slope of the \nmagnitude of this order makes the area unsuitable for groundwater development due to low \ngroundwater potential. In Himalayan Region groundwater mainly manifests in the form of springs. \nGroundwater mainly occurs under unconfined conditions and the water ta ble follo ws the \ntopography. Springs occurring in the entire state are generally confined to Central Crystallines \nandare of both types, viz., hot and cold. The hot water springs are structurally controlled  with a \ntemperature range of 320C to 900C and about 25 hot spr ings are reported from this region  with \ndischarge ranging from 1 to 10 lps. Out of 600 cold springs, with discharge ranging from <1 to 30 \nlps, 330 are located in (granites, gneiss, schists etc.), 180 in quartzites, 50 in shales / slates and \n40 in carbonate rocks.  \nThe river terraces are most significant repository of groundwater comprising assorted material \nsuch as boulder, cobble, gravel, sand and clays. The terrace material has been tapped, at few \nplaces, through open wells and bore wells.In Bhabar zone groundwater occurs under unconfined \nconditions and Water level is generally deep and observed as deep as 173.71 m bgl at Haldwani. \nTarai zone is characterized by moist, waterlogged area, which is gently sloping southwards (2.5 \nm/km). This zone is traversed by numerous perennial sluggish channels rendering the area \nswampy. \n8.22.1 Area Identified for Artificial Recharge/Rainwater Harvesting  \nArea suitable for ground water augmentation through artificial recharge has been demarcated \nbased on the analysis of ava ilable data on depth to water level (2018) and long -term post \nmonsoon water level trends (2009 to 2018) in the plain areas and foot hill areas.

Further, in urban areas, it has been proposed \nto practice artificial recharge measures to groundwater through available rooftop rainwater \nharvesting. \n8.22.2 Sub-Surface Storage Space and Water Requirement  \nIn Uttarakhand state, except Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar all other districts possess highly \nundulating topography where generally aquifer systems are very much localized. In the Outer \nHimalaya wherever alluvium or valley deposits occur they are relatively covered by bigger surface \narea than that of the Middle Himalayas.  The depth to water level in this alluvium terrainis very \nmuch variable than the plain area of Tarai and further beyond in the Gangetic Plain. Thus, \nsubsurface st orage space is hereby generalized for 2m as unsaturated zone.

Yamuna (5421.18 sq.km), Ganga (25757.74 sq.km), Ram Ganga \n(11466.34 sq.km) and Sharda (11024.81 sq.km) spread over Uttarakhand. Rainfall is the primary \nsource of the water availability in the area. The artificial recharge structures proposed is bas ed \non the available water resources. There is enormous quantity of surplus water flows down to the \nsouthward plain area. The total water available from these four river basins as surface runoff is \n67302 MCM.

    "basins as surface runoff is \n67302 MCM. The surplus water usually generated by run-off, base flow and snow melt. The actual \nassessment of volume of surface water by such river basins has not been quantified due to paucity \nof data, but it is obvious that rivers, rivulets, streams and nallas of Himalayan Mountains are very \nmuch perennial. Only the first and sometime second order of streams is seasonal in nature. \nHence, the volume of source water available for recharge has been computed on the basis of \n50% of the average annual rainfall (1254 mm) in Uttarakhand, which is feasible in the area. So \non this account; it has come to 5335MCM as source water for recharge. \n \n8.23.3 Recharge Structures and Cost Estimates  \nThe major part of Uttarakhand is hilly with localized small valleys through which the entire run-off \npasses. As the area is hilly with high relief, the major part of the rainfall is lost as surface run-off. \nApart from this the small rivers, nallas also act as carriers for base flow and spring water. In spite \nof good rainfall in hilly areas there is acute shortage of water especially during t he summers. \nFurther availability of water is restricted in these streams only. Thus, the water in the streams \nshould be harvested and tapped for irrigation and domestic needs through various rainwater \nharvesting structures and water conservation measures b e adopted. The broad valleys in hilly \narea are the feasible locales for check dam construction where gentle slope (less than 20%) \nprevails, whereas in the plain area, check dams and percolation tanks are more appropriate \ninterventions to be adopted. Roof top rainwater harvesting can be practiced in both the terrains; \nrather this should be given more emphasis in hilly areas specially to combat the water crisis.  \nUdham Singh Nagar district has, by and large, plain topography with very shallow water levels; \nhence roof top rainwater harvesting is the only feasible option available in this area. Haridwar",
    "is.  \nUdham Singh Nagar district has, by and large, plain topography with very shallow water levels; \nhence roof top rainwater harvesting is the only feasible option available in this area. Haridwar \ndistrict on the other hand possess deeper water levels in Bahadarabad, Roshanabadand and Lal \nDhang areas giving thereby the scope for artificial recharge through  construction of appropriate \ninterventions like gabions, recharge shafts, injection wells, check damsand gully plugs etc., \nwhereas in the southern part, the rooftop rainwater harvesting may be practiced. Doon Valley \ncovering parts of Dehradun district is most suitable area for interventions to be made for getting \nrecharge to the groundwater bodies artificially through constructing suitable site specific \nstructures. In the remaining hilly districts of Uttarakhand, contour bunding, brushwood check \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n149 \n \n \ndams, gully plugs, continuous contour trenches, chalkhal, percolations tanks etc. may be adopted \nfor augmenting the groundwater resources and harvesting the rainwater as well.  \nEfforts of State Government in water conservation \nThe State Government (Avas and Shahri Vi kas) has formulated mandatory regulations for \ninstallation of Rainwater Harvesting System and directed to adopt rules in building by -laws. \nAccordingly, all the development authorities have made amendments in the prevalent house \nbuilding and development by -laws/ regulations. Further, through different schemes, water \nconservation measures have been taken up in the State by the Directorate of Watershed \nManagement and the rainwater harvesting and water conservation structures have been \nconstructed under the Utt arakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Projects (UDWDP), \nIntegrated Livelihood Support Program (ILSP), PMKSY -Watershed Development Program and \nGramya.

The normal annual rainfall is around 1923 mm out of \nwhich, the State receives 1618 mm in the Monsoon Season (June to September) and rest 305 \nmm in the non -monsoon season. The hilly Himalayan region receives the heaviest rainfall \nranging from 2,500 to 6,000 mm, the southern districts in the plains receive on an average \nrainfall from 1125 to 1875 mm. It  is the only state of India that extends from the Himalaya to \nthe Bay of Bengal. A large portion of the state occupies the transitional zones between the \nHimalayas in the north and the Chhotanagpur plateau in the west to the plains of the Ganga-\nBrahmaputra delta in the southern and eastern sections. There are three major river basins in \nthe State, viz., Ganga, Brahmaputra and Subarnarekha. The Himalayan tracts of West Bengal \ncomprise the districts Darjeeling &Kalimpong and parts of Jalp aiguri and Alipurduar districts \nand occupies a total geographical area of 3017.34 SqKms. The area is drained by perennial \nTista, Torsa, Mahananda, Balason, Jaldhaka, Kaljanias also many other small rivers. In spite \nof copious rainfall received to the tune of 3000 mm or more per annum, extreme water scarcity \nis felt in the area during the lean periods  (January to April).Groundwater development in this \ntract is negligible and it is mostly catered through springs.

However, \nincipient to moderately developed drainage channels are available in Little Nicobar and in  all \nthe other islands of Nancowriegroup.Since the islands are underlain predominantly by \nimpervious marine sedimentary(turbidite) group of rocks, deeper infiltration of ground water \ncannot take place and profuse base flow from the shallow aquifers, formed  in numerous \nstream valleys could be seen which are flowing unabatedly to the sea. The weathered \nresiduum down to a depth of 15m and at places shallow fractures also yield water for water \nsupply in islands. In many Islands perennial springs are generated along the surface openings \nof fractures/sink holes and topographic lows which cater to a great extent to the rural \npopulation. Even the sustainable water supply of the capital city of Port Blair is poised on inter-\nisland spring water supply from contiguous Rutland Island. Keeping in view of the importance \nof springs in the Islands, the development of springs is needed along with catchment area \ntreatment through construction of proper recharge structures at appropriate locations \nespecially in the upstream sid e of the spring discharge area which is popularly known as \nSpring shed area.

Punjab state borders the UT in the south and south-western sides and Haryana state \non the eastern side. The city has an area of 114 sq. km, out of which 34 sq. km is rural and \nremaining 80 sq. km is urban. \nChandigarh is a highly urbanized city and the rooftop rainwater harvesting can be an ideal \ntechnique to augment the groundwater availability. There is lot of green area too and some \nwaterbodies that can be effectively utilized for recharging the rai nfall runoff. In Chandigarh, \nthere are two distinct aquifer systems–shallow and deep. Shallow aquifer occurs under semi-\nconfined conditions and exists down to 20 to 30 m below land surface. Deep aquifers below \n40m are under confined conditions. The aquifer  in the area are under semi -confined to \nconfined conditions. It is evident from the fact the ground water extraction for drinking purpose \nthrough 200 nos. of tube well is mainly from deeper aquifers (200 m), however the decline in \nshallow water table can b e observed. Hence, recharging of shallow aquifer can also induce \nrecharge deeper aquifer due to head difference.   \n8.25.1 Identification of Area  \nBased on the post monsoon depth to water level of the year 2018 and long term ground \nwaterlevel trends (2013 to 2018),it has been estimated that the whole city area (114 sq. km) \nis feasible for artificial recharge.  \n8.25.2 Sub-Surface Storage & Water Requirement \nThe tota",

The water required for artificial recharge to saturate the \naquifer up to 3m bgl is 15.01 (Table 8.26.1).  \n8.26.3 Source Water Availability \nThe surface water resources available in the su b basin was calculated based on information \nprovided by the State / UT government. The data available for each sub basin included \ncommitted runoff, reserved for future planning and surplus water available. A total of 6.50 \nMCM run off/surface water is avail able in the UT of DNH and can be utilized for artificial \nrecharge. Invariably the proportionate surface water availability is less (6.50 MCM) and the \nrequirement of surface water for AR is more (15.01 MCM). Further, only 75% of the surface \nwater available was considered as available for artificial recharge since the entire surface \nrunoff availability cannot be considered as many un -planned recharge activities through \nNGO’s and other private organizations are also being taken -up in the UT of DNH. Thus, the \nproportionate surface water availability for artificial recharge is 7.0 MCM.

Accordingly, \nthese structures have been recommended for artificial recharge. \nThe amount of surface water considered for planning the artificial recharge is 4.87 MCM. \nBased on the field situation it has been considered that 70% storage would be through \npercolation tanks and remaining by check dams. Accordingly, 3.41 MCM (70%) will be stored \nin percolation tanks, 1.46 MCM will be stored in Cement plugs/check da ms. Therefore, 17 \npercolation tanks, 49 check dams/cement plugs in the identified areas of UT of Dadra and \nNagar Haveli (Table 8.26.2). The percolation tanks should be constructed on second and third \norder drainage, on favorable hydrogeological and physiog raphical locations. The cement \nplugs can be constructed on 1st and 2nd order of drainage. The density of structures per sq.km. \nis to be planned realistically to make it implementable on practical considerations. \nThe average cost of construction of a percolation tank (100 TCM single filling storage capacity) \nwas taken as Rs.1.47 Cr, whereas that of cement plugs or masonry check dam of 10 TCM \nsingle filling capacity was taken as Rs. 0.15394 Cr as per Common Schedule of Rates (CSR). \nThe estimated cost of Rs. 32.53 cr. is required to take up artificial recharge (Table 8.26.2). \n8.26.5 Roof Top Rain Water and Runoff Harvesting In Urban Areas \nConsidering the over -all demographic, climatic, hydrogeological, physiographic and socio -\neconomic set up and quality of the source water available in the urban areas, following \nrecharge techniques are proposed: Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting (RTRWH), Runoff \nRainwater Harvesting \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) –",

As per 2011 census there are 6 urban towns the UT of Dadra \nand Nagar Haveli viz., Silvassa (MCl), Dadra (CT), Naroli, Samaravarni (CT), Masat (CT), \nRakholi (CT). In these 6 urban towns there are 40364 households. The exact size of individual \nhouse is not available, therefore an average roof size is adopted as 50 sq.m. for calculation of \nroof area. The estimation of water available from roof top harvesting is worked out by \nmultiplying the district wise roof area with average annual rainfall for the period 2009-18. \nThe number of households in all the 6 urban towns are 40364.

It is observed that around 30% of the houses are having their own wells \nin the premises, which can be utilized for harnessing roof top rain water. Thus 12109 \nhouseholds in 6 urban towns shall be covered under this scheme. The average cost for \nproviding the necessary arrangements through pipe fittings etc. in the houses where \ndugwells/borewells are already existing, shall be around Rs. 30,000 per house. The estimated \ntotal cost comes out to be Rs. 36.33 crores for covering all the 6 urban towns. \nThe total roof area of these households (12109) comes out to be 0.605 sq.km., which will be \nable to harness 1.489 MCM of rainwater annually. The plan of roof top rain water harvesting \nis given in Table 8.26.3. The above quantity of rainwater is received at rooftop but same is not \navailable down the roof due to various losses in the form of moisture absorption, evaporation \nlosses and leakage etc. Therefore 80% of the above figure i.e., 1.191 MCM is considered \navailable for harvesting the rainwater which will be taken as source for artificial recharge to \nground water. The recharge efficiency of the structure s is considered 75%, thus ultimate \nrecharge potential available by RTRWH is about 0.893 MCM. It is estimated that about 48,436 \nadditional urban population would get adequate water supply round the year by implementing \nthis scheme. \nRunoff Water Harvesting \nThe rainfall runoff flowing from the roads and open grounds is substantial during rains. This \nwater often creates the water logging and the drainage system is put under stress in the urban \nagglomerates. This ultimately flows out of the city unutilized.

A scheme suitable for artificial recharge in urban area was \nprepared by C.G.W.B and was successfully i mplemented and operated at Nagpur Municipal \nCorporation ground. In this scheme about 15000 sq.m of residential catchment was \nintercepted and runoff generated was diverted into the specially constructed recharge well in \nthe public garden. The runoff water w as filtered silt free by providing a filter pit. Number of \nsuch locations can be identified within city areas where such structure may be constructed to \nprovide a sustainable ground water based water supply in the city. \nIt is estimated that in 6 urban areas of UT of DNH around 30 schemes would be needed with \nan average of 5 schemes per town/city. The cost of each scheme will be around Rs. 7.5 lakh. \nTherefore, an expenditure of Rs. 2.25 crores is estimated for taking up the scheme.

The depth of the hand pumps is about 60 to 70 m bgl. Few \ntubewells tapping valley fill deposits are also present in this district which are being used \nmainly for domestic water requirements.  \nRain water harvesting either for storage in surface tanks or artificial recharge to ground water \nin depleted aquifer areas have become very essential. Even in urban areas of J&K and \nLadakh, water required for domestic uses is mostly drawn from surface water bodies, \ngroundwater is also tapped for water supply. In f ew pockets, it has led to declining trend in \nground water levels. This necessitates the urgent need to take appropriate remedial measures \nin the form of artificial recharge to ground water in these pockets so that the problems can be \nsolved at initial level. Moreover, in hilly areas and remote areas, roof top rainwater harvesting \nis an ideal alternative to meet the daily water requirements.  \nAppropriate storage facilities can be created to store roof top rainwater depending on \navailability of space. Rainwater harvesting in urban areas helps not only in meeting at least a \npart of the water requirement but also prevents storm runoff. In rural area, ponds, streams and \nwells have traditionally been used as sources of water for drinking and other domestic uses in \nouter plains,  whereas, in hilly areas, seasonal nalas and springs arethe sources of water \nsupply.

In recent years, bore wells with hand pumps and small water supply schemes have \nalmost replaced these traditional sources of water.  \nIn cold desert area spreading whole of Ladakh region, 80% of largely agrarian population rely \nupon glacial melt water for irrigation, domestic supply and even hydropower.  Less snowfall \nand melt water are already affecting the lives of farmers here. Receding glaciers due to global \nwarming means less recharge to ground water and less discharge in springs. Kuhlas supply \nwater to farmers on turn basis for one or two hours in a month or so. Recently, artificial \nglaciations and snow water harvesting are being considered as an alternati ve solution for \nretreating glaciers. One of the major advantages of this artificial glaciations and snow water \nharvesting is that the field get water way before the actual glaciers start to melt in May- June.  \nIn Kandi region of outer plains, high altitude  Karewa Plateaus spread around the Kashmir \nvalley and Intermountain Plateaus like Dada, Kishtwar, Baderwah, Banihal plateaus where \naverage rainfall is more than 1000 mm, these areas face acute water scarcity especially during \nsummer due to very high runoff resulting from high topographic gradient of 1:60 to 1:100. The \nfragile eco-system of these region is prone to erosion and as a result, high rate of siltation \ntakes place in the ponds which necessitates periodic de-silting.

For \nexample, in hilly districts like, Poonch, Ramban or Kargil, even though the ground water \ndevelopment is at nascent stage, availability of water for meeting the domestic and irrigation \nrequirements is meager and people are dependent on meager sources like springs and \nseasonal nalas. In such districts, areas with water crisis are identified and the areas fo r rain \nwater harvesting may be delineated. The criteria for rain water harvesting shall not be dictated \nby the criteria of declining water levels or availability of surplus monsoon runoff.  Construction \nof check dams, storage ponds and surface storage of r oof top rain water etc are identified \nbased on the utility of these structures for solving the water supply problems in  the areas \ninstead of recharge oriented. The ponds present in the Kandi belt and high plateau Karewa \ntable lands can also be good recharge structures. But the water thus recharged flows out as \nsub- surface flows to the neighboring areas without much use to the local people. The \nschemes prepared in this district are taken into consideration of the hardships being faced by \nlocal people and m odification shall be done to the recharge schemes as per the local \nconditions. Thus large scale artificial recharge to ground water is not feasible in these Union \nTerritories and instead small schemes prepared in mitigating the water supply problems are \nrecommended. \n \n \nFig. 8.28.1.

    "ion \n \n174 \n \n \n8.29 LAKSHADWEEP ISLANDS \nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep is a group of islands scattered in west coast of India and \nlies about 220 to 440 km from coastal city of Cochin in Kerala. It is an archipelago consisting \nof 12 atolls, three reefs and five submerged banks. The Lakshad weep group consists of a \nstring of 36 islands covering an area of 32 sq. km., of which only 10 are inhabited. They are \nAndrott, Amini, Agatti, Bitra, Chetlat, Kadmat, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Kiltan and Minicoy. Apart \nfrom the ten inhabited islands, Bangaram, t he only island open to international tourists, is \nseasonally inhabited.  Total population of Lakshadweep is 64473 (2011 Census) with \npopulation density of 2015 persons per sq.km. About 74 percent of the population resides in \nurban area. \n8.29.1 Availability of Subsurface Storage for Artificial Recharge \nLakshadweep islands have a delicate ecosystem with very limited freshwater resource. The \nfresh groundwater resource of this densely populated tiny coral atolls of Lakshadweep, by and \nlarge, occurs as lenses flo ating in hydraulic continuity with seawater. The hydro -geological \nenvironment of these islands is complex hence availability of freshwater depends on factors \nsuch as size and shape of the islands, groundwater draft and rainfall pattern. Further the \nelevation of the island is very small due to which the storage capacity of the aquifer is limited \nwith no additional storage space for artificial recharge. All these factors makes fresh water a \nprime commodity. \nRainfall, averaging about 1640mm annually, is the so le source of groundwater recharge in \nthese islands. The rainfall distribution pattern of the Lakshadweep islands shows that the \naverage monthly rainfall is more than 40 mm for eight months a year, from May to December.  \nAs the thickness of fresh water lens  shrink during summer, the quality of groundwater \nbecomes brackish resulted in water scarcity in the islands. Hence rainwater harvesting and",
    "om May to December.  \nAs the thickness of fresh water lens  shrink during summer, the quality of groundwater \nbecomes brackish resulted in water scarcity in the islands. Hence rainwater harvesting and \nstorage is the most suitable and cost -effective solution to the water scarcity problems in the \nLakshadweep islands in view of the limited sub -surface storage available and the shallow \nwater table conditions. Further, most of the buildings are tiled roof or RCC roofs and hence \nideal for roof water harvesting.  \n8.29.2 Recharge Structures & Cost \nLakshadweep administration has widely recognized the role of rain water harvesting as most \nsuitable and adoptable way in supplementing the water supply very long back and it was \nwidely implemented in all islands. Government buildings including schools, quarters, and non-\nresidential buildings and some private houses had implemented community rain water \nharvesting systems by building tanks of various capacities ranging from 5m3 to 10 m3 or some \nplaces up to 50 m 3.  At present, rain water harvesting structures are implemented in 4532 \nbuildings which includes the entire government buildings. Apart from these, desalinization \nplants and Sea Water Reverse Osmosis plant have been established in three islands and one \nisland of Lakshadweep, which has the capacity of supplying 1 lakh and 25,000 litre desalinated \nwater/day respectively.   \nConsidering the rainfall pattern and existing water supply measures prevalent in the Island, \nthe rainwater harvesting systems may be designed to harvest the rainfall received in any two \nmonths of the year, excep t January, February, March and April to collect and store water \nenough to meet the requirements of the population for about 100 -120 days. The island wise \nstatus of roof water harvesting in operation, future scope and financial out lay required, taking \nNovember and December months as the collection period for Minicoy and October and \nNovember for remaining 9 islands, are worke",
    "esting in operation, future scope and financial out lay required, taking \nNovember and December months as the collection period for Minicoy and October and \nNovember for remaining 9 islands, are worked out and presented in Table 8.29.1.  Rainwater \nharvesting for the above two months are considered as it is sufficient enough to fill the storage \ntanks so as to supplement water needs in the ensuing summer months. Water storage during \nmonsoon season is not that significant as the well water cater the domestic needs. Thus by \nconsidering the monthly rainfall of two proposed months, harvestable volume was calculated \nConsidering the water supply from desalinization plant the storage capacity of tanks has been \nrestricted to 5m3. The proposed rain water storage in each island is worked out based on the \nnumber of new buildings. The cost involved in construction of roof water harvesting structure \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n175 \n \n \nis around Rs. 12/litre of tank capacity inclusive of eve gutters and fittings, calculated as per \nschedule of rates for the UT.

DPR has to be prepared at \nan implementable level like any other water supply project or city development project. \n \nThe area for artificial recharge has been identified based on post monsoon water level (2018) \nand long-term post monsoon water trend in most of the States & UTs. However, due to paucity \nof data and local groundwater issues, additional/different criteria were used in different \nStates/UTs. In the case of NE States, UT of Jammu & Kashmir & UT of Ladakh, the criteria of \nwater scarcity have been used and structures have been suggested to harness the run off \ngenerated from the rain. In case of UT of Lakshadweep & UT of Daman & Diu, due to shallow \ngroundwater level, only RTRWH has been suggested. An area of 11.23 Lakh sq.km has been \nidentified for artificial recharge.  \n \nThe scope of artificial recharge depends on the available sub surface space for recharge, \nwater required for recharge and surplus water available for recharge.  The volume of space \navailable up to 3m bgl or 5m bgl depending on the criteria adopted in different States multiplied \nby the specific yield of the aquifers will provide the space available for recharge. Considering \nan efficiency of 60% or 75% as deemed fit in different States, the water required fo r artificial \nrecharge has been worked out for each State. The surplus available for recharge after \ndeducting the committed supply has been estimated for each State. The available sub-surface \nspace for artificial recharge 537.349 BCM, while the water required to saturate the aquife",

The available sub-surface \nspace for artificial recharge 537.349 BCM, while the water required to saturate the aquifer up \nto 3 to 5m bgl is 716.917 BCM. The surplus source water available for recharge is of the order \nof 185.092 BCM.

The plan is macro plan formulated to work out the \nfeasibility of various structures to different terrain conditions and the estimated cost, when the \naction is expected to be taken for the whole country. At the outset CGWB would like to  state \nclearly that this master plan is like any other master plan prepared for a State or city, which \nbrings out the broad outline of the project and expected investments and for implementation, \nDPR has to be prepared at an implementable level like any other water supply project or city \ndevelopment project. \nThe water stress is being felt at different parts of the country owing to the increasing demand \nresulting from the population explosion. In order to meet the demand, the share of groundwater \nhas increased exponentially, it has far exceeded the natural recharge in many parts of the \ncountry, necessitating the both central and State government to take up water conservation \neffort through many schemes. The revised master plan will provide general guidance fo r \nterrain specific structures considering the availability of surplus source water and indicate a \nrough ball park figure for culminating such efforts.  \nMaster Plan for Artificial R",

Central State agencies have already many schemes, which have included the \ncomponent of water conservation as given below \nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee programme (MGNREGS)  \nIntegrated Watershed Development programme for rain fed areas (NWDPRA)  \nBharat Nirman \nIrrigated Agriculture modernization, water bodies restoration and management project \n(IAMWARM)  \nDrought prone area programme (DPAP)  \nNABARD assisted rainwater harvesting programme for augmentation of ground water \nrecharge  \nRehabilitation of tanks identified by MLAs  \nCommand area development & Water Management program  \nWater conservation in reserved forest area  \nLocal area development programme of M.P & M.L.A  \n \nIn addition, the scheme of Atal Jal has been initiated and the scheme aims at sustainable \nmanagement of ground water through community participation by addressing the supply side \n(augmenting the ground water table or arresting its decline) and demand side (by introducing \nwater conservation technologies/practices like drip, sprinkler, pressurized pipes to reduce \nground water consumption) interventions through convergence of ongoing schemes, along \nwith capacity building and institutional  strengthening initiatives in identified over -exploited / \nwater scarce areas in about 193 Blocks in parts of 78 Districts in Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, \nUttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Another scheme under \npreparation is the comp rehensive measures for water conservation in select water st",
    "ts in Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, \nUttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Another scheme under \npreparation is the comp rehensive measures for water conservation in select water stressed \ndistricts in the country, resulted out of Budget announcement of the Government. All these \nongoing and also the proposed schemes can utilize the revised master plan for preparation of \nDPR and take it further towards implementation.  \n \n9.2.1 Documentation of Water Conservation Efforts \nOwing to the over dependence on groundwater, both State & Central Government Agencies \nare dovetailing their activities towards water conservation. Consequently, construction of the \nartificial recharge structures has increased over the years. Further construction of structures \nalso depends on the surplus water availability and hence it becomes imperative that \ngeotagging of these structures are made and their functi onal status monitored. It I high time \nthat one of State agencies be made a nodal department for maintaining the database of \nartificial recharge structures and its functional status. The committee strongly feels that one \nNodal agency be identified for each State/UT by the respective States /UTs, which will function \nas a focal point for all water conservation database and documentations. \n \n9.2.2 Community Participation \nThe success of the scheme depends on the participation of community in the efforts of water \nconservation.  Many NGOs/PRI/VOs are already working actively in many States and if the \nparticipation is effected from the grass root level, the operation and maintenance of the \nstructures would be successful. Atal Jal Scheme is in that direction that it e nvisaged to be \nimplemented in participatory mode.  RTRWH is one scheme, where every individual can be \ntaken on his own in his/her house or taken as a community, if the building has a common roof. \nThe harvested water can be used even for drinking purposes and if treated waste water is also \nsupplied",
    "taken on his own in his/her house or taken as a community, if the building has a common roof. \nThe harvested water can be used even for drinking purposes and if treated waste water is also \nsupplied in a separate pipe line, reducing the use of fresh water, community can greater leap \ntowards optimal utilization of water resources.  \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n182 \n \n \n \n9.2.3 Industry Participation \nThe industries, while taking NOC in OCS Blocks, make provisions for artificial recharge/RWH \nand also as a part of CSR programme. The revised master plan can be used for preparing the \nDPR, if industries want to take up water conservation projects on larger areas. The \nrecycle/reuse of water has not been included in this study, as the quality of water available for \nrecharge needs to be ensured or else it would lead to the contamination of groundwater \nsystem. The industries may consider the use of treated waste water for uses other than \ndrinking so that the industrial demand can be made bare minimum and water saved is water \nconserved. Thus slowly, the industries should turn towards treated waste water for their use, \ninstead of fresh water for purposes other than drinking. \n \n9.2.4 Funding Mechanism \nThere are ma ny existing schemes and a new scheme is under preparation in respect of \ncomprehensive measures for water conservation in select water stressed districts in the \ncountry, resulted out of Budget announcement of the Government, which can cater to the \nimplementation of the revised master plan. No separate funding is required for executing the \nrevised master plan. The different scheme can take the cue from the master plan and construct \nthese structures as per the norms of the schemes. The execution of these structure may take \na period of 10 years, if the schemes dovetail their activities for convergence towards water \nconservation.  \n \n9.2.5 Guidelines for implementation of Artificial Recharg",

The guidelines have given emphasis on the \nwater quality of the source water, formation water in the aquifer and impact of contamination \nof the aquifer from the environment. In this section, the methodol ogy adopted in the master \nplan vis-a-vis the guidelines are discussed. \n \nThe guidelines provide a simple check list as water quality guide as given below. \n \n1.

The fresh water aquifers are only \nconsidered for recharge and further, the area identified for recharge is based on two factors, \nviz., Need and S cope for artificial recharge. The need is indicated by the water levels (>3m \nbgl during post monsoon period) so that the area does not get waterlogged. The scope for  \nartificial recharge is indicated by the availability of surplus source water and the ability of the \naquifer to accept the recharge. Hence, the simple assessment, viability assessment, \nguidelines applicability assessment and aquifer assessment of the check list given in Guide to \nManaged Aquifer Recharge are inherently included while preparing the master plan.

This is a broad conceptual plan, formulated to work out the feasibility \nof various Water conserv ation & recharge  structures for the different terrain conditions in \ndiverse hydro -geomorphological settings of the country. The information on respective \nestimated cost of the recharge structures, a broad outline of conceptualization of the project \nand expected investments  are provided. Considering, the technological advancement and \nvarious scientific activities being implemented parallely under different programs in various \nstates in the country, i t is prudent to revise the methodology to incorporate scien tific \ntechniques for different terrain conditions.  In the past, the identification of suitable areas  for \nwater conservation & recharge was selected by overlaying different thematic maps of the area \nprepared manually. GIS technology is now in practice & can be successfully utilized to \ndemarcate the recharge areas by superimposing various thematic maps  / layers using the \nDrastic approach by giving weights to various thematic layers  on GIS platform.

    "fforts had been made by CGWB for implementation of pilot & demonstrative artificial \nrecharge projects in coordination with state agencies with the view of their capacity building to \nreplicate the similar structures in adjoining similar terrain conditions. The Board is \nimplementing National Aquifer Mapping & Management programme (NAQUIM) in the country \nto understand aquifer disposition & their characteristics to prepare aquifer maps & \nmanagement plans. The output of NAQUIM studies are shared / being shared with state \nagencies as well as at distri ct level for suitable implementation through ongoing water \nconservations programs / schemes in such areas . NAQUIM studies also will provide \ninformation on groundwater extraction from different units’  / aquifer layers and thus areas of \nthe identified stressed aquifer units can be taken up for implementation of water conservation \n& artificial recharge measures by the state agencies . It would be prudent to recharge the \npertinent water stressed aquifers on priority so that adequate water is available to meet ever \nincreasing water demand. In this regard, the outputs of NAQUIM can provide excellent aquifer \ninformation inputs for conceptualising & implementing groundwater recharge projects. Many \nstates agencies have successfully  utilized the NAQUIM outputs provided  by CGWB in the \nidentification of recharge sites and structures type based on the aquifer disposition and terrain \nconditions. So far, the Master plan for artificial recharge to groundwater is a conceptual \ndocument, however by utilizing the a vailable technological advancements of GIS & remote \nsensing techniques , it would be feasible to  have micro -level information on area -specific \nfeasible recharge structures & their location. The same can be refined during preparation of \nDetailed Project Reports (DPRs) by the implementing agency in the state .

To take up water \nconservation & recharge measures at country-level, system-approach would be appropriate, \nwhich can be adopted by all the states uniformly to have maximum benefit in water \nconservation & artificial recharge. In order to create such a system, the following issues need \nto be taken into consideration:  \n \n1. Implementation Approach  \nThe implementation approach of artificial recharge projects shall depend on various factors \nand hence cannot be uniform. The major f actors controlling the approach  are  hydro-\ngeomorphological settings which varies in different terrain conditions. The watershed \napproach is best fit for hard rock terrains, while the basin/sub basin approach is practically \nfeasible for alluvial/sedimentary terrain having large & thick aquifers. Further, in hilly terrains, \nspringshed approach can be more scientific & useful in implementation of spring rejuvenation \nprojects. Depending upon the type of terrain conditions, the plan need to be conceptualised \nby collecting various information as described below: \n \n2. Scale for collecting information & conceptualising artificial recharge plan \nThe demarcation of feasible recharge areas at macro-scale is pre-requisite in any exercise of \npreparation of master plan on art ificial recharge. However, for implementation of the plan, \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n186 \n \n \ndetailed project report (DPR) is the basic scientific document which includes location specific \nsites of recharge structures, their type, design and costing, etc. For selection of watershed / \narea in a basin/ sub-basin / springshed for recharge activities, master plan on a large scale is \nrequired which can provide basic information of feasible recharge areas, so that any \nimplementation agency can initiate preparation of DPRs for such areas under any  running \npr",

In order to have a reliable accuracy, there is a need to have the plan at a \nlarger scale of 1: 10,000 on GIS platform.  \n \n3. Information / data as inputs Thematic layers  \nMost common thematic layers required for identification of the suitable sites of artificial \nrecharge are Topographic map, Soil Map, Land use/Land cover, Geomorphology, Aquifer \nmaps, water level maps etc. along with other layers depending upon the watershed / area of \ninterest. In order to prepare a recharge plan at a scale of 1:10;000 scale such inputs are also \nrequired to be collected through micro-level surveys on same scale.  \n \nThe GIS, remote sensing & LIDAR through Drone technologies can be utilized along with \ngroundtruthing surveys for collation of data and its translation into information  & thematic \nlayers using GIS on 1: 10,000.  \n \nIn view of the non -availability of such detailed information, large scale exercise was not \npossible in preparation of present master plan, however it is envisaged that designated state \nagencies will work on local scale for preparation of thematic layers on a large scale so that \ncomprehensive plan including tentative site locations and type of recharg e structures can be \nprepared in the next version of the plan. \n \n4.

    "ion of the plan. \n \n4. Standardized database  \nIt is essential to have detailed database on water bodies and already existing recharge \nstructures, so that assessment of surplus water can be worked out. NWIC under DoWR, RD \n& GR has already prepared a module for creation of database on artificial recharge structures \nand have intimated to all States to update  the database, which is yet to be initiated  by the \nStates. It is suggested that a State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) be identified by the State, to \ncoordinate all water conservation related work in the State and maintain the database.  \n \nSLNA can be entrusted  to pursue state line agencies implementing water conservation & \nrecharge projects / schemes to regularly update the information through mobile app / sharing \nthrough other platforms. The database will be managed and validated by the SLNA. Such \ninformation will also need to be available for direct access to the other departments \nimplementing the different schemes/projects in the respective state / UT at a regular interval.  \n \n5. Outputs  \nThe outputs of such studies will be in the form of maps and plans depicting area feasible for \nartificial recharge, availability of source / surplus water, site demarcation / location of proposed \nrecharge structures & their type. The information can be translated into Detailed Project Report \n(DPRs) with field investigations/validations for actual measurements for design / drawings and \ncost estimates of the structures. \n  \n \n \n6. Frequency of Revision \n The preparation of thematic maps on a larger scale by the identified State Agency may require \nat least 02 years for each State and preparation of master plan on a larger scale another 01 \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n187 \n \n \nyear.

Keeping a period of impact assessment of 2 years, the revision c an be taken up every \nfive years.  \n10.1 FORMULATION OF MASTER PLAN \nIt is pertinent to note that though the approach will be different for different terrain conditions \nbut the basic methodology for formulation of the plan will remain same for all the terrain s / \nhydro-geomorphic settings. The Hard rock terrain will opt for the  watershed approach, viz., \nvalley to ridge approach, while for areas of alluvial terrain, the sub basin/basin approach and \nSpringshed approach for the hilly terrains. The basic methodology irrespective of the scale will \nbe the same and is schematically represented below. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 10.1     Methodology for formulation of Master Plan \n \nThe above methodology would be able to provide broad information on the terrain condition, \nhowever the identification of feasible areas on a larger scale requires a detailed analysis of \ndata and its collation to translate into information. There are other methods available which \nhave been utilized for smaller area various researcher and academicians. These meth ods \nhave their limited applicability due to huge data requirements in GIS forms at local scale. \n \n \n10.1.1 DRASTIC GIS Models  \n \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n188 \n \n \nGIS technology can be utilized effectively to identify the areas for artificial recharge. GIS based \nDRASTIC Model is one such tool to identify suitable areas for recharge. The \nacronym DRASTIC stands for the seven parameters used in the  model which are: Depth to \nwater, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and \nhydraulic Conductivity.  Various thematic maps provide the information on different DRASTIC \nparameters. A generalized methodology to be adopted in collation of data from various \nsources is schematically given below. \n \n \n(Source: Senthilkumar etal., 2019 : https://doi.org/10.118",

    "y of source water / harnessable surplus run off \nneeds to be linked to terrain conditions to arrive at the number of feasible structures. Inter \nbasin/intra basin transfer can be used in case of less source water.  \n \nThe effectiveness of the any artificial recharge struct ures will be very much enhanced, if the \ntreatment of watershed in hard rock terrain, and treatment of springshed in hilly terrain is taken \nup prior to implementation of the artificial recharge projects. The treatment work will result in \nincreased soil mois ture conditions in upper reaches, which will supplement the artificial \nrecharge works undertaken on downstream side. However, the factor of slope stability needs \nto kept in mind while taking up treatment work in upper reaches, so that excavation should not \nresult in loosening up of soils leading to landslides.  \n \nThe preparation of master plan should have bottom to top approach, wherein the information \nat the level of the watershed/sub basin/springshed is collated to get the basin wise information. \nIn order to have administrative control over execution of schemes, the information collated on \nwatershed/sub basin basis can also be translated at the district level and State level, as the \ndata is being processed on GIS platform and scientific procedures are adopt ed in the \ncomputation of basic information. \n \n10.1.2. NAQUIM as Input to the Artificial Recharge Plans \n \nCGWB has taken up prestigious NAQUIM program throughout India. The objective of the \nNAQUIM is to provide scientific inputs for sustainable management of ground water resources \nin the countr y. The outputs of the NAQUIM are being prepared by CGWB on 1:50,000 and \nshared with States / UTs.  \n \nAquifer management plans prepared under NAQUIM, propose both supply side and demand \nside interventions and water conserv ation measures are covered in supply side measures. \nAquifer Management Plans prepared under NAQUIM provides the information on vertical and \nhorizontal extent of",
    "side interventions and water conserv ation measures are covered in supply side measures. \nAquifer Management Plans prepared under NAQUIM provides the information on vertical and \nhorizontal extent of aquifer units, available saturated aquifer thickness for developmental \npurposes and at the same time it also indicates available unsaturated thickness and using the \nstorage parameters of the aquifer units, available unsaturated volume, for taking up artificial \nrecharge studies can be worked out. These outputs have been included in NAQUIM reports \nand have been shared with State agencies and District Administration and also have been \nhosted in CGWB website.  The augmentation of spring discharge is also similar to that the \naquifer at depth, as most of the springs lie beneath the natural recharge area, it  would be \nappropriate therefore to treat the natural recharge area to augment the spring discharge. \nThese plans are being utilized by the State Agencies in siting of the recharge structures as \nwell as implementation of other management interventions as suggested.   \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n190 \n \n \nIn the focus areas the aquifer mapping is being proposed at much finer scale i.e. 1:10,000 \nscale. The master plan of such areas shall be prepared on 1:10,000 and the thematic maps \nas  listed below shall be collected/prepared. \n \nS.No Issue Proposed Action \n1 Thematic Maps \n(1:10,000) \n Nomination of SLNA by every State for preparation of thematic maps \n Allocation of requisite fund \n Hiring of GIS Experts at District & State Levels \n Focused work programme  \n2 Standardized \ndatabase \n A Module for artificial r echarge has already been prepared by NWIC and is to be \ntested with data by States \n Creation of database by respective States through SLNA \n Regular updating of database through web portal link or by SLNA \n3 Frequency of \nMaster Plan \nPreparation \n 05 years may be kept for revision con",

The process of DPR preparation is schematically presented below.  \n \nNowadays lot of technological innovations have come up which can help in conceptualization \nof proposals, processing of proposals and its final implementation. Further, timely executuion \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n191 \n \n \nof works is also very important with suitable resource/manpower interventions for which project \nmonitoring software can also be used by states/UTs to achieve the desired outcomes.  \n \nAn attempt has been made in this direction by Rajasthan to autom ate the DPR \nprocessing/preparation & its implementation etc  by using latest technological tools. Under \nMukhyamanthri Jal Swavlamban Yojna (MJSA), they have developed a web-based application \nfor online processing of case from preparation of project proposal  to approval to execution  \nwhich can be studied by various states/UTs for its efficacy/usefulness. \n \nThe critical factors which can make such tec",
    "cessing of case from preparation of project proposal  to approval to execution  \nwhich can be studied by various states/UTs for its efficacy/usefulness. \n \nThe critical factors which can make such technological applications successful is input of data \nof the existing recharge structures, surplus source water availability and other thematic layers \non a scale of 1: 10,000.  CGWB has prepared the NAQUIM outputs at a Scale of 1:50000 in \naround 70 % areas of the country and also working on to reduce the scale to 1:10000 in certain \nwater stressed Arid/Semi -arid areas. S tates/UTs are encouraged to use more and more \nCGWB data in their DPR preparations for water harvesting purposes.  Needless to mention \nhere that designating Nodal agency in each State is most essential to coordinate the various \nactivities of water conservations in the respective State through existing schemes / programs.  \n  \n10.3 INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM \nIn order to have a seamless project preparation, approval and execution, there should be a \ncommittee at district and State level. The district level committee will function under District \nCollector and will have all the line departments executing the schemes as members with a \nrepresentative from SLNA as Member Secretary.  The State Level Committee will function \nunder the Principal Secretary responsible for GW an d Heads of all Line Departments in the \nState as members and Head of SLNA as Member Secretary. CGWB will be a member of both \nState & District level Level committees  to provide technical guidance .  The master plan \nrevision, project preparation, approval and execution will be supervised by the State Level \nCommittees.   \n \n10.4 DOCUMENTATION  \nThe success of any project depends on the ability to evaluate the impact of the project and \nmake necessary modifications to resolve any unforeseen issues, which has arisen during the \nexecution.

    "e necessary modifications to resolve any unforeseen issues, which has arisen during the \nexecution. The proper documentation at various stages of execution and creation of robust \ndatabase is the first step in the project. SLNA for each State should be made responsible for \nthe repository and regular updation  through line implementing agencies at district-level. The \nartificial recharge module developed by NWIC, which is in the testing stage may be utilized for \nthe purpose. Each State needs to provide input to update the database on regular basis \nthrough designated SLNA.  \n \n10.5 CRITICAL FACTORS IN EXECUTION OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE PROJECTS \nGovernment of India is aiming not only at the revision of Master plan on a larger scale but also \nseamless project preparation, approval and execution of artificial recharge projects. There are \nmany critical factors, which will affect the aspirations of Government of India unless it is dealt \nwith appropriate measures. \n Identification SLNA by each State \n Establishment of GIS Lab and provision for hiring of GIS experts for both District & \nState Level  \n Creation of database on water conservation efforts & Regular updation of the database \nin the respective States. \n Allocation of fund by each State to SLNA for establishment of GIS Lab and for hiring \nof GIS experts for both District & State Level \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n192 \n \n \n Systematic treatment  of catchment of watershed, springshed through the existing \nschemes as precursor to taking up artificial recharge projects.  \n Finding efficacy of existing recharge structures, their operation & maintenance  \n Capacity building of local stakeholders on O&M structures  \n Dissemination of knowledge to local public on benefits of water conservation \n \n10.7 IMPACT ASSESSMENT \nThe impact of water conservation efforts on groundwater system need to be assessed so as \nto bring out the effectiveness of supply",
    "public on benefits of water conservation \n \n10.7 IMPACT ASSESSMENT \nThe impact of water conservation efforts on groundwater system need to be assessed so as \nto bring out the effectiveness of supply side interventio ns. Central Ground Water Board can \ntake up the impact assessment as a third party evaluator, as the implementation is being made \nthrough State Agencies. The updation of database on artificial recharge is mandatory for \ntalking up impact assessment and updation of database should be the responsibility of SLNA. \nCGWB can take up impact assessment work after one-year of completion of artificial recharge \nprojects, if the database is regularly updated. A general guideline for impact assessment has \nbeen published b y CGWB and uploaded in cgwb website ( http://cgwb.gov.in/AR/Final-\nGuideline-IA-AR-Studies-submitted-website-hosting.pdf). The impact assessment report can \nbe used by the State agencies to improve project formulation and execution. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnexure 1 \n \n \nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n193 \n \n \n \n \nAnnexure 1 (Contd…) \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n194 \n \n \n \n \nAnnexure 2 \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n195 \n \n \n \nAnnexure 2 (Contd…) \n \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n196 \n \n \n \nAnnexure 2 (Contd…) \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n197 \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater in India (2019) – A CGWB Compilation \n \n198 \n \n \nCONTRIBUTORS PAGE \n \n Committee Members \n \n1.

The augmented resource can be harvested in the \ntime of need. Artificial recharge to ground water is a \nprocess by which the ground water reservoir is \naugmented at rate exceeding that under natural \nconditions of replenishment. \n \nWater harvesting means to unde rstand the value of \nrain and to make optimum use of rain water at the \nplace where it falls.  \nIn general, water harvesting is the activity of direct collection of rain water. The rain water \ncollected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the ground water.  \n1.2 Importance/Need of RWH \nNEED \n To overcome the inadequacy of waters to meet our demands. \n  To arrest decline in ground water levels. \n To enhance availability of ground water at specific place and time and utilize rain water \nfor sustainable development. \n To increase infiltration of rain water in the subsoil which has decreased drastically in \nurban areas due to paving of open area \n To improve ground water quality by dilution \n To increase agriculture production. \n To improve ecology of the area by increase in vegetation cover, etc. \nADVANTAGES \n Cost of recharge to sub-surface reservoir is lower than surface reservoirs. \n\n2 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n The aq",

It includes: \n Individual homes \n Colonies  \n Apartments  \n Institutions  \n Schools/colleges/universities  \n Clubs  \n Hospitals  \n Industries \n Slums  \n Everywhere…… \nThe potential for rainwater harvesting is huge!!\n3 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n2 Types of rain water harvesting system \nRainwater harvesting can be categorized in a number of different ways, the most important of \nwhich are according to the type of catchment used and second based on type of collection \nsystem.    \nBroadly there are two methods of rainwater harvesting system based on type of catchment: \n(i) Roof top rainwater harvesting : It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In \nrooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the catchments, and the rainwater is collected \nfrom the roof of the house/building.  \n(ii)  Surface runoff harvesting :  In urban area rainwater flows away as surface ru noff. This \nrunoff could be caught and used for recharging aquifers by adopting appropriate \nmethods.        \nFor each type of catchment system different type of collection systems can be adopted. \nRainwater harvesting system based on type of collection systems are: \n(i) Storage : Harvested rain water can be stored in tanks or lakes and can be",
    "fferent type of collection systems can be adopted. \nRainwater harvesting system based on type of collection systems are: \n(i) Storage : Harvested rain water can be stored in tanks or lakes and can be used for direct \nconsumption \n(ii) Storage and groundwater recharge:  In this method rainwater is first stored in tanks or \nother system and surplus water is conveyed to recharge groun dwater. Recharged \ngroundwater can be used for consumption at later stage with handpumps or tubewells. \n(iii) Groundwater recharge only:  In this method collected rainwater is directly conveyed to \nrecharge groundwater without making any storage provision. Eg: groun dwater recharge \nthrough storm water drains or conveying water from road run-off to recharge pits. \n4 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n \n\n5 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n3 Technical details of Rainwater Harvesting system \n3.1 Roof-top Rain water harvesting system: \nAmong various techniques of water harvesting, roof top rainwater harvesting  needs special \nattention because of the following advantages: \na) Roof top rainwater harvesting is one of the appropriate options for augmenting ground \nwater recharge/ storage in urban areas where natural recharge is considerably r educed \ndue to increased urban activities.  \nb) Rainwater runoff which otherwise flows through sewers and storm drains and is wasted, \ncan be harvested and utilized. \nc) Rainwater is bacteriological safe, free from organic matter. \nd) It helps in reducing the frequent d rainage congestion and flooding during heavy rains in \nurban areas where availability of open surfaces is limited and surface runoff is quite \nhigh. \ne) It improves the quality of ground water through dilution. \nf) The harnessed rainwater can be utilized at the time of need. \ng) The structures required for harvesting rainwater are simple, economical and eco - \nfriendly. \nh) Roof catchments are r",
    "gh dilution. \nf) The harnessed rainwater can be utilized at the time of need. \ng) The structures required for harvesting rainwater are simple, economical and eco - \nfriendly. \nh) Roof catchments are relatively cleaner and free from contamination compared to the \nground level catchments. \ni) Losses from roof catchments are much less when compared to other catchments. \n \nCollection of rainwater from roof tops for domestic needs is popular in some parts of India. \nThe simplest method of roof top rainwater harvesting is the collection of rainwater in a \nlarge pot/vessel kept beneath the edge of the roof. The water thus collected can meet the \nimmediate domestic needs. Tanks made of iron sheets, cement or bricks can also be used \nfor storing water. In this method, water is collected from roofs using drain pipes/gutters \nfixed to roof edge. \n \nThough the practice of roof top rainwater harvesting is an age-old one, systematic collection \nand storage of water to meet the drinking water needs has become popular only recently. \nThe popularity of this practice is limited by the costs involved in collection of w ater by \ngutters/pipes and its storage in underground tanks made of iron or brick. Use of Ferro -\ncement technology in construction and maintenance of storage tanks has become popular \nin recent years as the strength and durability of ferro - cement structures have been found \nto make the schemes cost-effective. \n \n6 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nRainwater harvesting practices vary widely in size, type of construction material used and \nmethods of collection and storage. Easy availability of know -how on systematic and \neconomic methods of construct ion will encourage the user households to adopt this \npractice.

    "also a need for creating awareness and for development of simple \ntechniques of construction/fabrication of the components of rainwater harvesting system \nfor popularising this technique  as a potential alternative source of drinking water, at least \nfor part of the year. \n \nDesign considerations for Roof-top Rain water harvesting: \n The material of the catchment surfaces must be non -toxic and not contain \nsubstances which impair water quality.  \n Roof surfaces should be smooth, hard and dense since they are easy to clean and are \nless likely to be damaged and shed materials into water \n Precautions are required to prevent the entry of contaminants into the storage \ntanks.  \n- No overhanging tree should be left near the roof  \n- The nesting of the birds on the roof should be prevented \n- A first flush bypass such as detachable downpipe should be installed \n All gutter ends should be fitted with a wire mesh screen to keep out leaves, etc.  \n The storage tank should h ave a tight -fitting roof  that excludes light, a manhole \ncover and a flushing pipe  at the base of the tank.  \n The design of the tank should allow for thorough scrubbing of the inner walls and \nfloor or tank bottom. A sloped bottom and a provision of a sump and a drain are \nuseful for collection and discharge of settled grit and sediment.  \n Taps/faucets should be installed at 10 cm above the base of the tank as this allows \nany debris entering the tank to settle on the bottom where it remains undisturbed, \nwill not affect the quality of water.  \n \nComponents of Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting System \nIn a typical domestic roof top rainwater harvesting system, rainwater from the roof is \ncollected in a storage vessel or tank for use during periods of scarcity. Such systems are \nusually designed to support the drinking and cooking needs of the family and comprise \na roof, a storage tank and guttering to transport the water from the roof to the storage \ntank.

In addition, a first flush system to divert the dirty water, which c ontains debris, \ncollected on the roof during non-rainy periods and a filter unit to remove debris and \ncontaminants before water enters the storage tank are also provided. Therefore, a typical \n7 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nRoof top Rainwater Harvesting System comprises following components: \n1. Catchment  \n2. Transportation : Conveyance system and gutter \n3. First flush  \n4. Filter \n5. Storage facility \n1. Roof Catchment:  The surface that receives rainfall directly is the catchment. Sloping \nroof or flat roof.  A roof made of reinforced cement concrete (RCC), galvanised iron or \ncorrugated sheets can also be used for water harvesting. Coarse mesh at the roof to \nprevent the passage of debris.  Since rainwater is pure as it falls from the sky it is \nnecessary that the roof be kept clean for it to remain pure when it  is collected. This \nmeans the roof will need to be swept and cleaned daily during the rainy season. \n2. Transportation -Conveyance system and gutter : Channels all around the edge of a \nsloping roof to collect and transport rainwater to the storage tank. Gutters  can be \nsemi-circular or rectangular and could be made using: \na. Locally available material such as plain galvanised iron sheet (20 to 22 gauge), \nfolded to required shapes. \nb. Semi-circular gutters of PVC material can be readily prepared by cutting those \npipes into two equal semi-circular channels.  \nc. Bamboo or betel trunks cut vertically in half. \n \nThe size of the gutter should be according to the flow during the highest intensity rain. It \nis advisable to make them 10 to 15 per cent oversize. \nGutters need to be supported so they do not sag or fall off when loaded with water. The \n8 \nUrban Water Securit",

The \n8 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nway in which gutters are fixed depends on the construction of the house; it is possible to \nfix iron or timber brackets into the walls, but for houses having wider eaves , some \nmethod of attachment to the rafters is necessary. \nConduits  \nConduits are pipelines or drains that carry rainwater from the catchment or rooftop area \nto the harvesting system. Conduits can be of any material like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or \ngalvanized iron (GI), materials that are commonly available. \n \nThe following table gives an idea about the diameter of pipe required for draining out \nrainwater based on rainfall intensity and roof area: \nSizing of rainwater pipe for roof drainage  \nDiameter Of pipe (mm) Average rate of rainfall in mm/h \n  50 75 100 125 150 200 \n50 13.4 8.9 6.6 5.3 4.4 3.3 \n65 24.1 16.0 12.0 9.6 8.0 6.0 \n75 40.8 27.0 20.4 16.3 13.6 10.2 \n100 85.4 57.0 42.7 34.2 28.5 21.3 \n125 - - 80.5 64.3 53.5 40.0 \n150 - - - - 83.6 62.7 \nmm/ h - millimeters per hour; m - meters  \n \nSource: National Building Code \n \n3. First flush: A first flush device is a valve that ensures that runoff from the first spell of \nrain is flushed out and does not enter the system. This needs to be done since the \nfirst spell of rain carries a relatively larger amount of pollutants from the air and \ncatchment surface.  \n \n \n4. Filter: The filter is used to remove suspended pollutants from rainwater collected \nover roof. A filter unit is a chamber filled with filtering media such as fibre, coarse \nsand and gravel layers to remove debris and dirt from water before it enters the \n\n9 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nstorage tank or recharge structure.

Charcoal can be added for additional filtration. \nSelection of a filter depends on followings: \n1. Type of catchment \n2. Amount of silt load \n3. Quality of runoff \n4. Purpose of storage \n5. Type of recharge structure \n \n(i) Cloth filter: The simplest form of filter is a piece of fine cloth which is even \nnow used in areas like the north -east where they collect rainwater directly \nform the roof into storage tanks. It is also known as saari filter in Gujarat \nwhere people use a piece of saari filter (attire worn by Indian women) or dhoti \nfilter (attire worn by Indian men). \n(ii) Charcoal water filter : A simple charcoal filter can be made in a d rum or an \nearthen pot. The filter is made of gravel, sand and charcoal, all of which are \neasily available. \n \n(iii) Sand filters : Sand filters have commonly available sand as filter media. Sand \nfilters are easy and inexpensive to construct. These filters can be em ployed for \ntreatment of water to effectively remove turbidity (suspended particles like \nsilt and clay), colour and microorganisms. \n \n(iv) Inverted sand filter: It can filter medium to coarse sized sand &  silt particles, \nother floating debris along with bacterial contamination to limited extent.  \n \n(v) Dewas filters: Most residents in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, have wells in their \nhouses. Formerly, all that those wells would do was extract groundwater. But \nthen, th e district administration of Dewas initiated a groundwater recharge \nscheme. The rooftop water was collected and allowed to pass through a filter \nsystem called the Dewas fillter, designed by Mohan Rao, district collecter of \nDewas and engineers of the rural engineering services. The water thus filtered \nis put into the service tubewell. \n \n(vi) Desilting chambers -  Very effective & essential for runoff from unpaved and \npaved areas or from storm w",

The water thus filtered \nis put into the service tubewell. \n \n(vi) Desilting chambers -  Very effective & essential for runoff from unpaved and \npaved areas or from storm water drains carrying huge amount of silt, tree \nleaves and other debris  \n(vii) Weave wire filter:  It is made up of stainless steel and also of rigid PVC. It can \nfilter out suspended solids coming with runoff. This type of filter is incapable \nfor filtering any bacteriological contaminants if presents. The degree of \nfiltration is 100- 200 microns and capacity ranges between 5000- 45000 litres / \nhour. Therefore it can be used in the systems where rainwater is harvested for \n10 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nnon potable purpose only. \n(viii) Pop up filter:  Mr Shiva Kumar of Bangalore developed this design. The \nfiltration is the nylon sieve (60 mm dia) inserted inside rainwater pipe to arrest \ncoarse particles.  The advantage with this filter is that whenever the filter gets \nclogged, it comes out of the casing and easy to maintain. \n \n5. Storage facility: The rainwater storage tank collects all the filtered rainwater and keeps \nit for future use. The storage tank is made above the ground and on a platform. It can \nalso be an underground sump. \n \nGenerally, Two basic types of storage system: \n Underground tank or storage vessel \n Ground tank or storage vessel \n \nA variety of materials and different shapes of the vessels  are available for the storage \nof rainwater. The choice of the system will depend on several technical and econo mic \nconsiderations like, space availability, materials and skill av ailable, costs of buying a \nnew tank or construction on site, ground conditions, local traditions for water storage \netc. \n      \n3.2 Surface run-off Rain water harvesting system \nSurface run-off rain water harvesting system is also sometimes called as stormwater harvesting. \nStormwater is generally harvested from road",
    ". \n      \n3.2 Surface run-off Rain water harvesting system \nSurface run-off rain water harvesting system is also sometimes called as stormwater harvesting. \nStormwater is generally harvested from roads, parks, garden, parking spaces, etc.  \nRainwater Harvesting from Roads: \nIn the recent past, rapid growth in the urba n areas has led to asphalted roads and stone slabs \nor pavers for footpaths. Consequent to this, the rainwater run -off has increased and ground \nwater recharge has declined.  As the roads are built sloped towards the sides, rainwater falling \non the road is gu ided to the side drains. When it rains, water flows from the apex to the sides \nand collects in the sidewalk area and subsequently flows to the storm water drains.  \nStorage facility in the system may not be provided if stored water is not needed for immedia te \nuse. The filter unit and recharge structure may some times be combined depending upon the \nquantity of run-off and the availability of the space. A rainwater harvesting system for an urban \nroad is shown in Fig ure below. In this case, an open unlined chann el is used as conduit. The \ncoarse mesh / grill to arrest the debris is installed at the inlet of the recharge structure. The first \nflushing device and the storage tank are optional. The filter unit may also be combined with the \nrecharge structure. \n \n11 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n \n \n \n \nRainwater harvesting system for urban roads: \n \nTo increase ground water recharge by \npercolation and decrease the flooding of \nstorm water drains, an infiltration trench \ncould be built by the side of the drain all \nalong the road, wherever possible. The \ninfiltration trench can be 2 feet wide and 2 \nfeet deep and filled with pebbles or \naggregates with a top layer of coarse river \nsand. \nAs the rainwater from the road flows into \nthe infiltration trench, water percolates \ninto the ground. During heavy rainfall, \nexcess water spills over to t",
    "es with a top layer of coarse river \nsand. \nAs the rainwater from the road flows into \nthe infiltration trench, water percolates \ninto the ground. During heavy rainfall, \nexcess water spills over to the storm water \ndrains. The infiltration trenches store water \ntemporarily during rainfall and later for \ninfiltration. These infiltration trenches may \nbe exposed as walk ways or paved with \ninter-locking pavers, specially designed  with gaps in between for water to flow into the \ninfiltration trenches. \n\n12 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nRainwater Harvesting from Parks and Open Spaces: \nWater harvesting methods in parks and open spaces involve micro -watershed management \nmethods that allow rainwater infiltration and perc olation into the ground. The runoff has to be \nminimized by providing adequate number of percolation pits and dispersion trenches. In large \nparks, storage of rainwater in small ponds is also possible since the ponds can be integrated \nwith the landscape of t he park. Mapping of the contours, planning for rainwater outflow in \nconsonance with natural drainage patterns, identifying appropriate areas for percolation pits / \ndispersion trenches will be required. \nRecharge of pits or trenches  : Ground water recharge i n parks can be enhanced by a simple \ntechnique of providing recharge pits or a trench. \n Width of pit: 1.2 to 1.5 m. Depth: 2.5 to 3.0 m. \n Material: 40-60 mm coarse gravel followed by 20 mm aggregates and 2 mm sand. Pits \nare conveniently made at suitable low -level micro -watershed locations as collection \ncenters of surface runoff. \n A splash pad is provided on top of the sand layer to cut off the velocity of entry of water \nto the pit. \n The number of such pits is based on the park area and the small rivulets dissect ing the \nlandscapes into micro-watersheds. \nRequirements \n Creation of water harvesting ponds in concave depression and low-lying areas. \n Allowing groundwater rech",
    "ea and the small rivulets dissect ing the \nlandscapes into micro-watersheds. \nRequirements \n Creation of water harvesting ponds in concave depression and low-lying areas. \n Allowing groundwater recharge by the creation of seepage pits. \n Allowing surface runoff to enter into existing wells or artificial water bodies. \nNatural flow of water : \nSurface runoff water should be trapped in ponds, tanks and lakes when available, so that it can \nbe used for maintenance during dry periods.  This practice is similar to dry land technology of \nagricultural belts. Low-lying areas and drainage channels are earmarked and convenient micro -\nwatersheds are prepared.  Water harvesting is followed based on natural flow and surface \naccumulation of the runoff water.  Water follows the lowest contour gradient available for that \narea. These structures not only provide water for the park, but also increase groundwater \nrecharge. Providing a bore well in these areas will enhance the availability of water in its \nvicinity. Rainwater run -off from open space and paved areas can be stored  in underground \nsumps by filtering through sand-bed filters and guiding the filtered water through channels. \n13 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n \n3.3 Storage Units \nTypes of storage system:\n \nThe storage tanks are provided if the water is intended to be stored for ready use.

Number of persons in the household: The greater the number of persons, the greater \nthe storage capacity required to achieve the same efficiency of fewer people under the \nsame roof area. \n2.  Per capita water requirement: This varies from household to household based on habits \nand also from season to season. Consumption rate has an impact on the storage \nsystems design as well as the duration to which stored rainwater can last. \n3.  Average annual rainfall \n4. Period of water scarcity: Apart from the total rainfall, the pattern of rainfall -whether \nevenly distributed through the year or concentrated in",
    "d rainwater can last. \n3.  Average annual rainfall \n4. Period of water scarcity: Apart from the total rainfall, the pattern of rainfall -whether \nevenly distributed through the year or concentrated in certain periods will determine \nthe storage requirement. The more distributed the pattern, the lesser the size.  \n5.  Type and size of the catchment: Type of roofing material determines the selection of \nthe runoff coefficient for designs. Size could be assessed by measuring the area covered \nby the catchment i.e., the length and horizontal width. Larger the catchment, larger the \nsize of the required cistern (tank). \nDry season demand versus supply approach \nIn this approach there are three options for determining the volume of storage: \n1. Matching the capacity of the tank to the area of the roof \n2. Matching the capacity of the tank to the quantity of water required by its users \n3. Choosing a tank size that is appropriate in terms of costs, resources and construction \nmethods \nIn practice the costs, resources and the construction methods tend to limit the tanks to smaller \ncapacities than would otherwise be justified by roof areas or likely needs of consumers. For this \nreason elaborate calculations aimed at matching tank capacity to roof area is usually \nunnecessary. However a simplified calculation based on the following factors can give a rough \nidea of the potential for rainwater collection. \n3.4 Recharge units \nRainwater may be charged into the groundwater aqu ifers for withdrawal later. Various \nrecharge structures are possible - some which permit the percolation of water through soil \nstrata at shallower depth (e.g., recharge trenches, recharge pits and permeable pavements) \nwhereas others conduct water to greate r depths from where it joins the groundwater (e.g. \nrecharge wells: dug wells and bore wells). At many locations, existing structures like wells, pits \n17 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nand tanks c",
    ". \nrecharge wells: dug wells and bore wells). At many locations, existing structures like wells, pits \n17 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nand tanks can be modified as recharge structures. Here are a few commonly used recharging \nmethods:  \nRecharge pits: A recharge pit is 1.5m to \n3m wide and 2m to 3m deep. The \nexcavated pit is lined with a brick/stone \nwall with openings (weep -holes) at \nregular intervals. The top area of the pit \ncan be covered with a perforated cover.  \nPercolation pits: Percolation pits, one of the easiest \nand most effective means of harvesting rainwater, \nare generally not more than 60 x 60 x 60 cm pits, \nfilled with pebbles or brick jelly and river sand, \ncovered with perforated concrete slabs wherever \nnecessary.  \n \nRecharge trench es: A recharge trench is a \ncontinuous trench excavated in the ground and \nrefilled with porous media like pebbles, boulders or \nbroken. bricks. A recharge trench can be 0.5 m to 1 \nm wide and 1 m to 1.5 m deep. The length of the  \nrecharge trench is decided as per the quantity of \nrunoff expected. The recharge trench should be \nperiodically cleaned of accumulated debris to \nmaintain the intake capacity.  \nRecharge troughs: To collect the runoff from paved or unpaved areas of a compound , recharge \ntroughs are commonly placed at the entrance of a residential / institutional complex. These \nstructures are similar to recharge trenches except for the fact that the excavated portion is not \nfilled with filter materials. In order to facilitate speedy recharge, boreholes are drilled at regular \nintervals in this trench. This structure is capable of harvesting only a limited amount of runoff \nbecause of the limitation with regard to size.  \nRecharging of dugwells and abandoned tubewells:  Rainwater that  is collected on the \ncatchment is diverted by drain pipes to a settlement or filtration tank, from which it flows into \nthe recharge well (borewell or dugwell). If a",
    "doned tubewells:  Rainwater that  is collected on the \ncatchment is diverted by drain pipes to a settlement or filtration tank, from which it flows into \nthe recharge well (borewell or dugwell). If a tubewell is used for recharging, then the casing \n\n18 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n(outer pipe) should preferably be a slotte d or perforated pipe so that more surface area is \navailable for the water to percolate. Developing a borewell would increase its recharging \ncapacity (developing is the process where water or air is forced into the well under pressure to \nloosen the soil strata surrounding the bore to make it more permeable). If a dugwell is used for \nrecharge, the well lining should have openings (weep -holes) at regular intervals to allow \nseepage of water through the sides. Dug wells should be covered to prevent mosquito bree ding \nand entry of leaves and debris. The bottom of recharge wells should be desilted annually to \nmaintain the intake capacity.  \n \nRecharging through tubewells:  In this case the catchment runoff is not directly led into the \nservice tubewells, to avoid cha nces of contamination of groundwater. Instead rainwater is \ncollected in a recharge well, which is a temporary storage tank (located near the service \ntubewell), with a borehole, which is shallower than the water \ntable. This borehole has to be provided with a casing pipe to \nprevent the caving in soil, if the stratum is loose. A filter chamber \ncomprising of sand, gravel and boulders is provided to arrest the \nimpurities.  \nModified injection well: In this method water is not pumped into \nthe aquifer but allowed t o percolate through a filter bed, which \ncomprises sand and gravel. A modified injection well is generally \na borehole, 500 mm diameter, which is drilled to the desired \ndepth depending upon the geological conditions, preferably 2 to \n3 m below the water table  in the area. Inside this hole a slotted \ncasing pipe of 20",

Inside this hole a slotted \ncasing pipe of 200 mm diameter is inserted. The annular space  \nbetween the borehole and the pipe is filled with  gravel and \ndeveloped with a compressor till it gives  clear water.

The water requirements of \nthe presidential estate are huge since there are \nabout 7,000 people residing in the estate. \nApproximately 3,000 people visit the presidential \npremises everyday .The Mughal Gardens in the \nestate require a lot of water. The total demand is \nabout 2 million litres of water per day (730 million \nlitres per year). This demand is met  through the \nNew Delhi Municipal Corporation supply and the \nestate’s own borewells. \nSince about 35 per cent of the water requirements are being met through groundwater sources, there \nhad been an alarming decline of groundwater levels in the estate. Levels have gone down by 2 to 7 m in \nthe past decade, with one well running dry. \n \n  \n        \n\n24 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n \nMeasures taken for water harvesting \nThe rainwater endowment of the area is 811 millions litres annually. Estimated cost of installing the \nsystem is Rs. 20 lakh (work on some components of the system was still underway in May 2000). \nFollowing measure were planned for the estate: \na.

Well recharging: Overflow from the 1 lakh litre capacity rainwater storage tank mentioned above is \ndiverted to two dugwells for recharging. Rainwater from the southern side of the roof is diverted for \nrecharging a dry open well. Rainfall runoff from the staff residential a rea is also diverted to the dry well. \nWater passing into the recharge well is passed through a desilting tank to remove pollutants. The 9 lakh \nlitre capacity swimming pool in the estate is planned to be connected to the dry dugwell, so that during \nperiodic emptying of the pool, water can be used for recharging instead of being drained away. \nc. Recharge shaft: 15 m deep recharge shafts will be constructed in the staff residential area. Rainwater \navailable from rooftops, roads and parks will be used for recharging. \nd. Johad: A johad is a crescent -shaped bund which is built across a sloping catchment to capture the \nsurface runoff. Water accumulating in the  johad percolates in the soil to augment the \ngroundwater. Johadshave traditionally been used in Rajasthan f or harvesting water.

The plan has been prepared in association with the Centre for Scientific \nand Industrial Research (CSIR) which will provide the bacteria to purify the wat er. As per the plan, \ninitially the pilot project will have the capacity to treat about 20,000 litres per day and the project will \ninvolve not more than Rs. 0.1 million. The treated water will be used for irrigation purposes in the \ncolony and major portion of it will also be used in the Society office and Panchsheel Club, including use \nin the flush. But the Society is planning to take it extensively after the initial success, which will include \nsupplying the treated water to toilets of flats in the coming years. The residents will have to spend to get \nthe water from the main pipe to their toilets. This project can set another example for other \nassociations, as according to experts, the use of specially developed bacteria to purify the water will \nbring down the cost of wastewater treatment. \n4.5 Mumbai Case Study \nSea Crown CHS, Charkop, Kandivali (W) \nWater situation before RWH :The supply of water does not meet \nthe",

Thus \nthe BMC water is used for potable purposes only. The society no more calls for tankers to fulfil their \nwater requirements.  \nDirect Monetary Benefits: A saving of Rs.1 to 1.5 lakhs per month that was earlier spent on tankers \n4.6 Jubilee colony, Bhuj \nJubilee colony in Bhuj  was facing problem water logging year after with loss of property and large \ndamage.  Many solutions were tried in society for avoiding water logging problem but none of them \nworked on it. Society members along with JSSS ( Jalastrot Sneh Samvardhan Samiti ), an community led \ngroup working on community -led water management, studied the flooding issues. The society was \nfacing flooding issues because of increased in level of surrounding roads. The outlets that carried water \nthrough storm water drain towards Jeevanram Tank were blocked and any solution that required letting \nthe water out of the colony was impossible to work.  Solution decided was innovative,  to increase the \ncapacity of the ground to absorb the water , which would help the water to permeate in the g round. It \ncould solve the problem of water logging on one hand and recharge ground water on the other. In \nfuture, it could help the members of the housing association during summer or whenever there is water \nscarcity. \n\n26 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nThe ground of two common plots in the colony was deepened and three recharge wells were dug up to \n18’ to 20’ depth.

They were filled in layers with big stones, jelly stones (gravel) and rough sand. In one of \nthe wells, a recharge bore -well that went to 100’ depth was dug. This increased the wa ter absorption \ncapacity of the land and solved the problem of Jubilee colony. \n \n \n4.7 Rainwater harvesting at Fankfurt airport, Germany  \nIn 1992 and 1993, water emergency was declared in parts of the state of Hesse. Groundwater levels in \nthe urban areas of Frankfurt fell so low that plants started dying. Lakes and rivers fell dry. Public water \nsupply in Germany is heavily dependent on groun dwater reserves. Most rainwater, mainly from roofs \nand paved surfaces, flows into the sewer. \nMunicipalities have developed a tax system to promote rainwater harvesting. Residents are charged \nseparately on the basis of paved and sealed areas in their houses , such as backyards and drive-ins. A tax \ninspector measures the paved area roof area to calculate the amount of run -off it will generate. Tax is \nlevied according to this. Since July 1992, there is a levy of DM 1 (us $0.58 at present rates) per cubic \nmetre of freshwater flowing into the sewer. The funds are used to protect groundwater resources.  \nResidents who have set up a system to catch rainwater or have left the above-mentioned areas unpaved \nare exempted from the tax. This is a monetary incentive to popularise rainwater harvesting. \nThe Frankfurt airport system is biggest in Germany as case of rain water harvesting system and helps to \nsave approximately 1,00,000 cum of water per year. The cost of the system is 1.5 million dm (us$63000) \nin the year 1993. Th e combination of huge catchment areas and simple technology has worked \nwonders.

    "e year 1993. Th e combination of huge catchment areas and simple technology has worked \nwonders. A system of rainwater harvesting was installed with an expectation of handling 13 million \npeople every year, the system collects water from roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 \nsquare meters. The water is collected in the basement of the airport where six tanks have been put up, \nwith a storage capacity of 100 cubic meters (cu m), the water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering \nplants and cleaning the air conditioning system with refined river water. Rainwater is being harvested at \ntwo huge complexes in Germany. \n\n27 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n \n4.8 The Thai Rainwater Jar Programme  \nThailand's National Jar Programme, to supply of clean drinking water to \nrural areas, was launched in response t o the United Nations' Water Supply \nand Sanitation Decade (1981 -1990). The Program's objective was to \npromote the use of jars in rural households as a means of supplying clean \ndrinking water.  Nearly 10 million rainwater jars constructed in 5 years \n(1985-1990). Jar construction techniques are similar to ferrocement tank \nconstruction techniques. \n  Factors favouring rapid development RWH programme are: \n• a real felt need for water \n• a preference for the taste of rainwater  \n• the availability of cheap cement and skilled artisans \n• a pool of indigenous engineers, technicians and administrators committed to rural \ndevelopment programme\n\n28 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n5 Rain Water Harvesting Potential of Bhuj \n5.1 Rainwater Harvesting in Bhuj Context \nBhuj city is located in the arid region of Kachchh in Guja rat.

    "irsar Lake was \nthe main source of water for the people of Bhuj. The king at that time created the traditional water \nmanagement system by linking lakes and wells. The entire water resource management system was \ndesigned to satisfy water demand of the city even in a drought year.  \nBhuj is characterized by low and highly variable rainfall pattern. The average annual precipitation is 330 \nmm. But even in the years of low rainfall intensity is high with large amount of rainfall falling in short \nperiod of times. Hence most of water is wasted  as runoff and very little is absorbed in the ground.  Also \nconcerting of roads and paved surface area have reduced water infiltration capacity, which is  causing \nthe problems of water logging during rainy season.  \nTherefore, there is a need for developing well designed water management system which would collect \nlarge amount of surface runoff rapidly and also help in recharging which would increase groundwater \nlevels in Bhuj area. \nThere is also continuous extraction of ground water with rapid decline in gro undwater quantity and \nquality. Lakes which were traditional sources of water supply are also disappearing. \nIn order to address above issues, there is a need, for adopting Rain Water Harvesting system in Bhuj. \n5.2 Estimation of Rainwater Harvesting Potential in Bhuj \nThe estimation of quantity of water that can be harvested is the first step in planning and design of RWH \nsystems. The quantity depends on the area of catchment and the annual average rainfall of the region. \n \n5.2.1 City level Rain water harvesting  potential \nTotal area of Bhuj is 56 sq km with annual average rainfall of 330 mm.  \nTotal Area- 56 Sq Km (BHADA Area) \n\n29 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \nHabitat area- 18.28  Sq Km \nAssuming only 50% of habitable area to be roofed and only 70% of water falling on it is collected. \nAnnual average rainfall of Bhuj- 330 mm \nTherefore, Rain water Harvesting pot",
    "at area- 18.28  Sq Km \nAssuming only 50% of habitable area to be roofed and only 70% of water falling on it is collected. \nAnnual average rainfall of Bhuj- 330 mm \nTherefore, Rain water Harvesting potential of Bhuj – 2111.3 ML \nConsidering 365 days, Rain water harvesting potential per day of Bhuj City is 5.78 MLD, Which is 18.5% \nof present water supply. \n5.2.2 Residential properties Rain water Harvesting Potential \nThere are total 30000 residential properties in Bhuj (As per PAS-SLB 2014-15 data).    \nConsidering minimum roof area (A) : 150 Sq mt (Assumed by taking samples of residential properties \nroof size from google imagery) \nAnnual average rainfall of Bhuj (R)- 330 mm \nConsidering 70% of water falling on roof to be harvested  \nTherefore, Total Rain water harvested : A*R= 34,650 litres \nConsidering 365 days, rain water harvesting potential per day per household is 95 litres/day. So Total \nrainwater harvesting potential for all 30000 properties will be 2.85 MLD, which is 10.5% of present \nwater supply. \n5.2.3 Commercial properties Rain water Harvesting Potential \nConsidering minimum roof area (A) : 250 Sq mt (Assumed by taking samples of commercial properties \nroof size from google imagery) \nAnnual average rainfall of Bhuj (R)- 330 mm \nConsidering 70% of water falling on roof to be harvested  \nTherefore, Total Rain water harvested : A*R= 57,750 litres \nConsidering 365 days, rain water harvesting potential per day per property is 158 litres/day. \nIf we assume that, out of total 11370 non-residential properties, 70% of properties is commercial and \nremaining 30% is institutional then, total commercial properties RWH potential would be 1.26 MLD. \n5.2.4 Institutional properties Rain water Harvesting Potential \nThere are large institutional properties in the Bhuj viz.

Thus, institutional properties should \nimplement RWH within their campus and help city to be water secured and self-reliant. \n5.2.5 Parks /Gardens Rain Water Harvesting Potential \nIn parks and gardens creation of ponds, tanks and shaft storage at low lying can be considered.  \nTotal area in Bhuj under parks and gardens:    0.19 Sq Km \nAnnual average rainfall of Bhuj (R)- 330 mm \nConsidering 70% of water to be harvested  \nTherefore, Total Rain water harvested : A*R= 44 Million litres \nConsidering 365 days, rain water harvesting potential per day is 0.12 MLD.  \nParks and gardens are abstracting huge quantity of groundwater for watering purpose and thus it should \nstart harvesting rain water which would increase groundwater level. \n \n \n \n31 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n6 Enabling Environment for implementing Rainwater \nHarvesting system  \nAn enabling environment and governmental support are essential for spreading the concept \nand implementation of rainwater harvesting systems on a city level  scale.

    "n enabling environment and governmental support are essential for spreading the concept \nand implementation of rainwater harvesting systems on a city level  scale. Mainstreaming in \npolicy agendas, facilitating regulations, awareness raising, capacity building and technical know-\nhow are all important for enhancing the use of rainwater harvesting systems.  It is also \nnecessary to ensure sustainability of rain water harvesting movement.   Following main \nmeasures can be taken \n Regulations for Rain water Harvesting system: \nIn India  under the constitutional set up, water is a state subject. In urban areas its \ngovernance rests with urban local bodies in their areas of jurisdiction as per the 74th \nconstitutional amendment. The need for a policy framework  and proper regu lations \namendment for rain water harvesting system  arises mainly because the existing regulation \nis not very effective along with lack of implementation and monitoring mechanism.   \nBased on this  argument, review was carried out for rain water harvesting regulations in \ndifferent cities (Details in Annexure -7.1). Following actions need to be adopted in order to \nimplement RWH in Bhuj city. \n- Make appropriate provision and regulations for rainwater harvesting – based on \nreview of DCRs from other cities. \n- Introduce tax incentives for stipulated timeframe to promote Roof rain water \nharvesting \n- Need to introduce rational tariff structure to promote RRWH \n- Introduce urban design/ landscape guideline to increase ground water recharge – \nDefine ratio for unpaved area to total  open area & Increase permeable surface area \nto recharge more  water through appropriate selection of material  \n \n Set Up RWH Cell:    \nIn order to make RWH effective , Bhuj Municipal council should Set up technical cell at ULB \nlevel for Capacity building and sensitize UL B staff towards promotion of rain water \nharvesting system.

The main objective for setting up the RWH  Cell is to create awareness \nand to offer technical assistance to the residents and also to provide to the citizens 'cost  \neffective solutions'. The RWH cell should undertake following points: \n \n- RWH Cell should have representatives from public, NGOs, Technical representatives, \nDevelopment Authority  \n32 \nUrban Water Security Planning Toolkit                                            \n- Develop material for technical details of implementing RWH structures \n- Provide RWH information on a website \n- Host a list of Architects, Contractors, NGOs, etc. qualified in undertaking design and \nimplementation of RWH structures.  \n- Plumber and contractor training programme on RWH component – Certification/ \nEmpanelment of contractor and plumber for RWH  \n- Demonstration models for RWH implementation should be demonstrated in schools  \nbuildings, government buildings, etc.  \n \n IEC Campaign:  \nIEC is an important component in influencing public to adopt Rainwater Harvesting. As they \nare the direct beneficiaries of these structures, more information dissemination would be \nrequired to make them construct Rainwater structures.  Public awareness and education are \nessential in order  to improve acceptance of rainwater collection and  utilization.  \nEfforts should be made to change public perception of rainwater from being viewed as a nuisance to \nbeing viewed as an asset.

    "Sustainable Future: 900 Rainwater Harvesting Pits to Come Up at RRTS Corridor\nGHAZIABAD, SEPTEMBER 7, 2025: In a major push towards sustainable infrastructure, the\nNational Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has announced a plan to construct\napproximately 900 rainwater harvesting (RWH) pits along the entire Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS\ncorridor. This green initiative aims to combat the region's depleting groundwater levels and mitigate\nurban flooding, setting a new benchmark for environmentally conscious development in India.\nThe project will be implemented across both the operational priority section and the remaining\nunder-construction stretches of the 82-kilometre corridor. Each pit is being strategically designed to\ncollect runoff from the massive surface area of the RRTS viaducts and station roofs, which would\notherwise contribute to waterlogging on the roads below.\n\"The RRTS is more than just a transit system; it's a commitment to a sustainable future for the\nNational Capital Region,\" said an NCRTC spokesperson. \"By integrating a large-scale water\nconservation system directly into the project's design, we are ensuring that our development\ncontributes positively to the local environment. These 900 pits are engineered to recharge the\ngroundwater table with millions of litres of water each monsoon season.\"\nThe system will function by channelling rainwater through a network of downtake pipes from the\nviaduct into the harvesting pits. These pits, filled with layers of gravel and sand, will filter the\ncollected water before allowing it to percolate deep into the ground, replenishing the natural aquifer.\nThis move has been lauded by environmental experts, who point to the severe water stress faced\nby cities like Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Delhi.\n\"Integrating rainwater harvesting with major infrastructure like the RRTS is a crucial and\nforward-thinking step,\" stated Sunita Narain, an environmental scientist and water conservation\nadvocate. \"Urban areas are becomi",

Issues such as benefit of RWH system, design considerations such as optimum tank \nsize, efficiency of RWh system, water quality related issues and available technologies for disinfection \nand filtration of rainwater, economic considerations, social challenges and effect of climate change have \nbeen discussed. Before designing a RWH system, it is important to know all these considerations so as to \narrive at a RWH solution which is optimal, meets the quality requirements and is economical viable.  \nKEY WORDS:   Rainwater harvesting; rooftop rainwater harvesting, design, water quality, economic \nbenefit, social issues, climate change \nINTRODUCTION \nRainwater harvesting (RWH) is increasingly becoming an integral part of the sustainable water \nmanagement toolkit (Ward  et al., 2012).  It is a technology where surface runoff is effectively collected \nduring the periods when enough rainfall occurs. Rainwater can be collected and stored from rooftops, \nland surfaces or rock catchments using simple techniques such as natural and/or artificial ponds and \nreservoirs (Helmreich and Horn, 2009). Such technologies are really important for  a country like India \nwhere effective rainfall is available only for 3 -4 months of the year",
    "r artificial ponds and \nreservoirs (Helmreich and Horn, 2009). Such technologies are really important for  a country like India \nwhere effective rainfall is available only for 3 -4 months of the year during the monsoon period. Basic \npremise is that the ra inwater falling at a particular location, if not harvested, would flow as surface \nrunoff and may not be available at that  location for later use . Harvested rain water can be used for \nrainfed agriculture or water supply for households. Present paper focuses  on rooftop rainwater \nharvesting (RRWH) for household needs. For RRWH, rainwater is collected from rooftops, court yards \nand low frequented streets and can be stored close to households. \n2 | P a g e  \n \nAttempts are made to highlight issues and challenges faced and to highlight present research work to \novercome these challenges.  There are s ome pertinent questions that need to be answered before an \nattempt is made to use RR WH technology; such as; 1. What are the benefits of the RR WH? 2. What are \nthe design related issues ? 3. What are the water qualities related issues?  4. What are the different \ntreatment technologies available? 5. Is it economical to use RRWH? 6. What are the social issues? and 7. \nIs climate change affecting the design and performance of RRWH?  \nBENEFITS OF RRWH  \nThe main advantage of RR WH is to provide water right near the household, lowering the long distance \nwalks burden of water collecting (Kahinda et al., 2007). Harvested rainwater is a renewable source of \nclean water which can be used for domestic purposes, garden watering and small scale productive \nactivities. It also contributes to reducing flood risks and the load on sewer systems. \nThe greater attraction of a rainwater harvesting system is the low cost, accessibility and easy \nmaintenance at the household level.  Though the c apital costs are high but neither operation nor \nmaintenance usually involves significant expenditure.  Rainwater harvesting seems to be a b",
    "and easy \nmaintenance at the household level.  Though the c apital costs are high but neither operation nor \nmaintenance usually involves significant expenditure.  Rainwater harvesting seems to be a beneficial \nmethod for minimizing water scarcity in developing countries. \n \nDESIGN RELATED ISSUES  \nThe main design related issues are how to design the storage tank and efficient RRWH system. The \nappropriate design and evaluation of RRWH system is necessary to improve system performance and the \nstability of the water supply (Mun and Han, 2012). The main design parameters of an RWH system are \nrainfall, catchment area, collection efficiency, tank volume and water demand.  Rainfall often varies in a \nrange of 200 – 600 mm/year from arid to semi -arid areas (Falkenmark et al., 2001).  As per Helmreich \nand Horn (2009), one millimeter of harvested rainwater is equivalent to one litre water per square metre. \nFig.1 shows the water demand satisfied by a tank as compared to its size  (Development Technology \nUnit, 2001). The benefit of a tank i s not strictly proportional to its size. The reason is that a smaller tank \nwill be filled and emptied often whereas a larger tank will only be cycled rarely.  \n \n \nFig. 1: Benefits of Tank Sizing (Development Technology Unit, 2001) \n\n3 | P a g e  \n \n \nWard et al., (2012) have presented the results of a longitudinal empirical performance assessment of a \nnon-domestic RWH system located in an office building in the UK. It compares actual performance with \nthe estimated performance and their result highlighted that the average measu red water saving efficiency \nof the office-based RWH system was 87% across an 8 -month period, due to the system being over -sized \nfor the actual occupancy level. Consequently, same level of performance could have been achieved \nusing a smaller-sized tank leading to reduction of capital payback period to only 6 years from presently \n11 years. Therefore proper design could lead to significant water and cost",
    "have been achieved \nusing a smaller-sized tank leading to reduction of capital payback period to only 6 years from presently \n11 years. Therefore proper design could lead to significant water and cost savings.  \nImteaz et al. (2011) have evaluated the design of rainwater tank for large roof areas, located in  \nMelbourne, Australia, based on observed daily rainfall data representing three different climatic regimes. \nThey developed a Decision Support Tool for the performance analysis and design of rainwater tanks.  \nCampisano and Modica (2012) have presented the dimensionless methodology for the optimal design of \ndomestic rainwater harvesting systems. Results of their analysis shows that the economical convenience \nof large tanks decreases as rainwater availability decreases.  Santos and Pinto (2013) evaluated six \ndifferent calculation methods, which are based on daily simulations of the system's operation using daily \nrainfall data and non-potable demand to size storage tanks in rainwater harvesting systems. Their results \nshow that methods based on the maximum rainwater use and 100% efficiency criteria result in very large \nstorage volumes and very long payback periods and therefore 80% efficiency criteria is most appropriate \nto size a rainwater harvesting system. \nKim et al. (2012) modified an existing analytic model for  estimating the runoff in urban areas to provide \na more economical and effective model that can be used for calculating rainfall–runoff reduction and \ndesigning the storage tank capacity by taking into account the catchment, storage tank, and infiltration \nfacility of a water harvesting system . The storage tanks can be built underground or aboveground. For \nstorage smaller storage tanks made of bricks, stabilized soil, rammed earth, plastic sheets and mortar jars \nare common. For larger quantities rainfall wate r containers can be made of pottery, ferro -cement, or  \npolyethylene. The  polyethylene tanks are compact but have a large storage c",
    "s and mortar jars \nare common. For larger quantities rainfall wate r containers can be made of pottery, ferro -cement, or  \npolyethylene. The  polyethylene tanks are compact but have a large storage capacity (Helmreich and \nHorn, 2009).  In order to be cost effective RRWH systems should  always be based on local skills, \nmaterials and equipment. \nThere remains a significant gap in knowledge in relation to detailed empirical assessments of \nperformance of RRWH systems (Ward et al., 2012). Additionally, there are few studies comparing \nestimated and actual performance. Palla et al. (2012) evaluated the performance of rainwater harvesting \nsystems under various precipitation regimes. Their results demonstrate that the antecedent dry weather \nperiod is the main hydrologic parameter affecting the system behavior. Mehrabadi et al. (2013) assessed \nthe applicability and performance of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems to supply daily non -potable \nwater under different climatic conditions. According to their results it is possible to supply at least 75% \nof non -potable water demand by storing rainwater from larger roof areas for a maximum duration of \n70% of the times in humid climate and only 23% times in arid climate. \n  \n \n4 | P a g e  \n \n \nWATER QUALITY RELATED ISSUES  \nWater security has been defined as “accessibility, reliability and timely availability of adequate safe \nwater to satisfy basic human need”. The question is how safe is rain water? Pure rainwater is mostly low \npolluted depending on the quality of the atmosp here. Atmospheric pollutants including particles, \nmicroorganisms, heavy metals and organic substances, accumulate on the catchment areas as dry \ndeposition and are washed out from the atmosphere during rainfall events. Rainwater in rural areas – \nbeing situated far from atmospheric and industrial pollution – is fairly clean except for some dissolved \ngases. On the other hand urban areas are characterized by a high traffic and industry impact and",
    "ng situated far from atmospheric and industrial pollution – is fairly clean except for some dissolved \ngases. On the other hand urban areas are characterized by a high traffic and industry impact and are \ntherefore contaminated by particles, heavy metals and organic  air pollutants (Helmreich and Horn, \n2009). \n \nUnfortunately, rainwater might be polluted by bacteria and hazardous chemicals requiring a vigilant \nchoice of the catchment area and treatment before usage. Precautions required in the use of storage tanks \ninclude provision of an adequate enclosure to minimize contamination from human, animal or other \nenvironmental contaminants, and a tight cover to prevent algal growth and breeding of mosquitoes \n(Helmreich and Horn, 2009).  \n \nTo harvest rainwater of good quality for human consumption, householders are encouraged to use one of \nthe various alternatives for roof washing, and collection or disposal of the first flush of rainwater from \nroofs since the first flush picks up most of the dirt, debris and bird droppings and  contaminants from the \nroof and gutters during dry periods (Abdulla and Al -Shareef, 2009). The simplest of these systems \nconsists of a standpipe and a gutter down-spout located ahead of the down-spout from gutter to the tanks \nor cisterns (Global Development Research Center, 2002). \nThe safety of water is determined at the household level by people’s perception and in the laboratory by \nabsolute measurements. Taste plays a major role in drinking water. As rainwater does not contain any \nminerals and does not ca rry any taste, it is not well widely accepted in urban areas as drinking water. \nConsumption is related to the perception of quality. Most of the rainwater tanks are generally not tested \nfor water quality; therefore, householders have no knowledge of true w ater quality and only have the \nperception of water quality (Abdulla and Al-Shareef, 2009). \n \nRainfall intensity and the number of dry days preceding a rainfall event signif",
    "ve no knowledge of true w ater quality and only have the \nperception of water quality (Abdulla and Al-Shareef, 2009). \n \nRainfall intensity and the number of dry days preceding a rainfall event significantly affect the quality of \nharvested rainfall. The quality of rainwater collected depends on when it is collected (after the first rain), \nhow it is stored as well as method of use. The stored rainwater will not always meet WHO standards \n(WHO, 1993). Rainwater is usually free from physical and chemical contaminants such as pesticides, \nlead, and arsenic, color and suspended materials and it is low in salt and hardness. Regular maintenance \nassists in gaining good qua lity water from rainwater tanks . The storage tank should be cleaned \nperiodically, inner walls and floor should be scrubbed, an d then cleaning of th e cistern using chlorine, \nfollowed by a thorough rinsing. Cracks should be patched with a non -toxic material, and access to the \ncistern should be taken into consideration while designing the tank (WHO, 1993).  Lim and Jiang (2013) \n5 | P a g e  \n \nhave discussed about the health risk concerns associated with household use of rooftop -harvested \nrainwater. The collected water should be chlorinated at least once every rainy season and preferably after \nthe cisterns are full of rainwater. The sources of microb iological contamination are the human and \nanimal waste present in the cistern catchment area. Cleaning the catchment area before the rainy season \nstarts is a must and people should be aware of that all the time. \n \nMendez et al. (2011) examined the effect of  conventional roofing materials (i.e., asphalt fiberglass \nshingle, Galvalume® metal, and concrete tile) and alternative roofing materials (i.e., cool and green) on \nthe quality of harvested rainwater. Results indicate that rainwater harvested from any of th ese roofing \nmaterials would require treatment if the consumer wanted to meet United States Environmental \nProtection Agency primary and",
    "water. Results indicate that rainwater harvested from any of th ese roofing \nmaterials would require treatment if the consumer wanted to meet United States Environmental \nProtection Agency primary and secondary drinking water standards or non -potable water reuse \nguidelines. They have mentioned that at a minimum, first-flush diversion, filtration, and disinfection are \nrecommended. Metal roofs tend to have lower concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria as compared to \nother roofing materials. Roofing material is an important consideration when designing a rainwater \ncatchment. According to Metre and Mahler (2003), rooftops are both a source of and a pathway for \ncontaminated runoff in urban environments. They found that concentrations of zinc, lead, pyrene, and \nchrysene in a majority of rooftop samples exceeded established se diment quality guidelines. Lye (2009) \nhas discussed about the heavy metal contamination specific to runoff from rooftop catchment areas \ncontaining exposed metal surfaces.  Lee et al. (2012) assess the quality of harvested rainwater on the \nbasis of the roofing materials used and the presence of lichens/mosses on the roofing surface. According \nto them, galvanized steel was found to be the most suitable for rainwater harvesting applications due to \nthe fact that ultraviolet light and the high temperature effectively disinfect the harvested rainwater. \n \nTREATMENT OF RRWH WATER \nFor disinfection purposes there are many techniques available, some of these utilizing natural sources \nsuch as solar energy.  Slow sand filtration and solar technology are methods to reduce the pollution. \nMembrane technology would also be a potential disinfection technique for a safe drinking water supply. \nAs per Amin and Han (2009), solar disinfection (SODIS) has been recommended by the World Health \nOrganization for rainwater disinfection . They have determined the efficiency of SODIS  and solar \ncollector disinfection (SOCO -DIS) for rainwater disinfection, an",
    "en recommended by the World Health \nOrganization for rainwater disinfection . They have determined the efficiency of SODIS  and solar \ncollector disinfection (SOCO -DIS) for rainwater disinfection, and its potential benefits and limitations.  \nAs per their finding SOCO -DIS system, disinfection improved by 20 –30% compared with the SODIS \nsystem, and rainwater was fully disinfected even under moderate weather conditions, due to the effects \nof concentrated sunlight radiation and the synergistic effects of thermal and optical inactivation. \nMicrobial inactivation increased by 10 –20% simply by re ducing the initial pH value of the rainwater to \n5. However high turbidities affected the SOCO -DIS system and the disinfection efficiency decreased by \n10–15%, which indicated that rainwater needed to be filtered before treatment. \nNawaz et al. (2012) used silver as antimicrobial agent to improve the quality of harvested rainwater. The \nefficiency of silver disinfection was evaluated at concentrations, ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/l . Results \nof their study indicated that higher inactivation and long term residual effect can be achieved with the \n6 | P a g e  \n \napplication of silver at 0.08 mg/l or higher under safe limit.  Vieira et al. (2013) developed a novel \nconcept for the filtration of particles  in raw rainwater with no energy usage, self -cleaning mechanism, \nand simple installation and operation in buildings. They have utilized up -flow filtration with down -flow \nbackwashing operation. \nECONOMIC ISSUES \nRainwater does not require chemical, physical n or biological treatment before use for most non -potable \ndemands. This makes maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems generally easy and cheap \n(Environment Agency, 2003).  It has been reported that rainwater harvesting can promote significant \nwater saving in residences in different countries (Abdulla and Al -Shareef, 2009). In Germany, a study \nperformed by Herrmann and Schmida (200) showed that the potential",
    "ting can promote significant \nwater saving in residences in different countries (Abdulla and Al -Shareef, 2009). In Germany, a study \nperformed by Herrmann and Schmida (200) showed that the potential of potable water saving in a house \nmight vary from 30% to 60%, depending on the demand and roof area . In Australia, Coombes et al. \n(2000) analyzed 27 houses in Newcastle and concluded that rainwater usage would promote potable \nwater saving of 60%. In Brazil, a study performed by Ghisi et al. (2006) showed the potential water \nsaving by using water harvest ing in 62 cities ranges from 34% to 92%, with an average potential for \npotable saving of 69%. \n \nThe capital cost of rainwater harvesting systems is highly dependent on the type of catchment, \nconveyance, cistern or tank size and storage tank materials used. In addition to the cost of components, \nthere is the cost of having the system installed. The most expensive part of a rainwater system is usually \nthe cistern itself (Abdulla and Al-Shareef, 2009). Before making the decision whether or not to go ahead \nwith a system at home, it is worth considering the water needs against the cost of installing and \nmaintaining it. While the startup cost of a rooftop catchment system may be significant, the long -term \noperation and maintenance costs are reasonable. \nFarreny et al. (2011) have determined the cost efficiency of rainwater harvesting in dense Mediterranean \nneighbourhoods. There results indicate that RWH strategies in dense urban areas under Mediterranean \nconditions appear to be economically advantageous only if carried out at the appropriate scale in order to \nenable economies of scale, and considering the expected evolution of water prices.  Imteaz et al. (2011) \nhave performed the payback period analysis of the tanks, which reveals that the total construction cost of \nthe tanks can be recovered within 15 –21 years’ time depending on tank size, climatic conditions and \nfuture water price increase rates.

    "tanks, which reveals that the total construction cost of \nthe tanks can be recovered within 15 –21 years’ time depending on tank size, climatic conditions and \nfuture water price increase rates.  Rahman et al. (2012) investigated the water savings potential of \nrainwater tanks fitted in detached houses at 10 diff erent locations in Greater Sydney, Australia. It was \nfound that the average annual water savings from rainwater tanks are strongly correlated with average \nannual rainfall. It was also found that the benefit cost ratios for the rainwater tanks are smaller t han 1.00 \nwithout government rebate.  Chiu et al. (2009) have proposed methodology for optimized rooftop \nrainwater harvesting systems and provides an energy -saving approach for hilly communities. Their \nresults also revealed that rainwater harvesting becomes economically feasible when both energy and \nwater savings are addressed together. \n \n \n7 | P a g e  \n \nSOCIAL ISSUES \nEven though RWH is a helpful technique for areas with scarce water resources there are some problems \nhindering the integration and implementation (Helmreich and Horn, 2009). Often the technology used is \ninadequate to meet the requirements of the region or else is too expensive. Sometimes there is a lack of \nacceptance, motivation and involvement among users. Hydrological data and information for confident \nplanning, design and implementation of RWH systems are missing. Additionally there is often an \ninsufficient attention to social and economic aspects such as land tenure and unemployment. Often the \npeople’s knowledge with regard to RWH and use is inadequate and  outdated giving away the benefits of \nrain water resources. Absence of long-term government strategies is also a handicap. \nDomènech and Saurí (2011) suggested that both regulations and subsidies are good strategies to \nadvocate and expand rainwater harvesti ng technologies in residential areas.

    "egulations and subsidies are good strategies to \nadvocate and expand rainwater harvesti ng technologies in residential areas. However, a multidirectional \nlearning environment needs to be promoted to ensure a proper use of rainwater harvesting systems and \nrisk minimisation. \nCLIMATE CHANGE RELATED ISSUES \nAccording to Youn et al. (2012), recent precipitation patterns have changed due to climate change and \nwill likely continue to do so, RWHS designs must take future precipitation forecasts into account. They \ndeveloped a methodology for establishing the probabilistic relationships between the stora ge capacity \nand deficit rate of an RWHS when considering climate change. \nCONCLUSIONS \nIt is well established that RWH is a water management strategy for increasing the availability of water at \nwater scarce regions. RRWH has been discussed and issues and challenges related to its benefits, design, \nquality considerations, economical and social issues and climate change have been discussed and latest \nresearch has been reported. It is highlighted that significa nt cost cutting can be achieved by proper \ndesign of RRWH system. It is important to be conscious of water quality related issues specially if \nharvested water is used for drinking purpose. It should be properly evaluated for meeting the drinking \nwater specifications.   \nREFERENCES \nAbdulla, F.A. and Al -Shareef, A.W., (2009), “Roof rainwater harvesting systems for household water \nsupply in Jordan,” Desalination, 243 (1-3), pp. 195–207. \nAmin, M.T. and Han, M.Y., (2009), “Roof -harvested rainwater for potable purp oses: Application of \nsolar collector disinfection (SOCO-DIS),” Water Research, 43 (20), pp. 5225–5235. \nCampisano, A. and Modica, C., (2012), “Optimal sizing of storage tanks for domestic rainwater \nharvesting in Sicily,” Resources Conservation and Recycling , 63, pp. 9-16. \nChiu, Y.R., Liaw, C.H. and Chen, L.C., (2009), “Optimizing rainwater harvesting systems as an \ninnovative approach to saving en",

INTRODUCTION \n \nNear Real Time Rainfall monitoring of the country is one of the major activities of \nhydrometeorological services of India Meteorological Department (IMD) which is operational \nat Hydrometeorology Division in the office of Director General of Meteorology. The \nGovernment of India initiated District -wise Rainfall Monitoring Scheme in 1989 on persistent \ndemands from Ministry of Agriculture, Planning Commission, Prime Minister’s office and other \nagencies. Data from  6495 rain gauge stations under  the District wise Rainfall Monitoring \nscheme (DRMS) is used in preparation of the real time rainfall statistics for different spatial \nand temporal scale. Rainfall Normal have been computed using the daily rainfall records of \n50 years (1971-2020) of a network of 4311 Stations all over the India. The spatial distribution \nof the DRMS rain gauge network which was used in computation of normal rainfall have \nbeen depicted in Figure 1. \n \nThe long period average (LPA) of winter, pre -monsoon, southwest monsoon and post \nmonsoon rainfall are 39.8 mm, 130.6 mm, 868.6 mm and 121.0 mm respectively. The LPA of \nannual rainfall is 1160.0 mm, but it is highly variable in spatial and temporal scale. The areas \non the Western Ghats and the Sub -Himalayan areas in North East and Meghalaya Hills \nreceive heavy rainfall of over 2500 mm annually, whereas the Areas of Northern parts of \nKashmir and Western Rajasthan receive rainfall less than 400 mm. The temporal distribution \nof LPA rainfall over the four seasons viz.",
    "of over 2500 mm annually, whereas the Areas of Northern parts of \nKashmir and Western Rajasthan receive rainfall less than 400 mm. The temporal distribution \nof LPA rainfall over the four seasons viz., winter (Jan -Feb), pre-monsoon (March to May), \nsouthwest monsoon (June to September) and post monsoon (October to December) are 3, \n11, 75 and 11% respectively. So, most of the rainfall received in the four rainy months, June \nto September. \n \nThe operational near real -time rainfall statistics is provided on daily, weekly, monthly, 4 \nseasons i.e. Winter (Jan-Feb), Pre-Monsoon (Mar-May), Southwest (SW) Monsoon (Jun-Sep) \nand Post-Monsoon (Oct-Dec), and on annual basis. \nभारत के िर्ाा आंकड़े – 2024 \n2024 \nRainfall Statistics of India – 2024  \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n2. METHODOLOGY \n \nThe rainfall statistics is computed based on the receipt of rainfall data from about 6495 \nstations spread over the entire country. Based on daily rainfall data of these stations, the \nrainfall of all the districts are computed and using the rainfall of the districts, rainfall statistics \nfor the Meteorological (Met.) Subdivisions, states where as using met sub-division rainfall data \nthe four broad regions and for the whole country have been prepared. The present publication \nincludes the updated rainfall statistics for the country as a whole, for all the four broad regions \nof India, 36 Met. Subdivisions, all States and UTs and 729 Districts of India. The statistics is \nprovided on monthly, 4 seasons i.e. Winter (Jan -Feb), Pre-Monsoon (Mar-May), Southwest \n(SW) Monsoon (Jun-Sep) and Post-Monsoon (Oct-Dec), and on annual basis. \n \n2.1 Generation of Rainfall Statistics (District/Subdivision/state/Country and four homogenous \nregions) \na.

Urbanization, \nindustrial development & increase in agricultural f ield & production has resulted in overexploitation of \ngroundwater & surface water resources and resultant  deterioration in water quality. The conventional \nwater sources namely well, river and reservoirs, et c. are inadequate to fulfill water demand due to \nunbalanced rainfall.While the rainwater harvesting system investigate a new water source. The aim of the \npresent study is to use rainwater and thus taking c lose to the concept of nature conservation. In this  \nstudy, the rain water harvesting (RWH) system is an alyzed as a alternative source of water at campus o f \nGovernment College of Engineering, Aurangabad (GECA ) in the state of Maharashtra, India.

The \nexpected outcome of the study is the development of  rainwater harvesting system for catchment area of \ncampus from parking area, workshop area, some of th e electronics department area upto Hostel ‘A’. The \nresult analysis shows that the present RWH system i s having the storage 53,96,816 litres/year and \nconstruction cost of Rs.5 lakhs respectively and is reasonably well in comparison with conventional water \nsources. The developed system satisfies the social requirements and can be implemented in rural areas by \nconsidering almost all the technical aspect. \n \nKeywords: Catchment, Rain water harvesting, Recharge pit, QGIS.  \nI. INTRODUCTION \nRainwater harvesting is atechnology used to collect , convey and store rain water for later use \nfrom relatively clean surfaces such as a roof, land  surface or rock catchment. RWH is the \ntechnique of collecting water from roof, Filtering and storing for further uses. Rainwater \nHarvesting is a simple technique of catching and holding rainwater where its falls. Either, we can \nstore it in tanks for further use or we can use it to recharge groundwater depending upon the \nsituation. RWH system provides sources of soft, hig h qualitywater reduces dependence on well \nand other sources and in many contexts are cost eff ective. RWH system is economically cheaper \nin construction compared to other sources, i.e. well, canal, dam, diversion, etc. \n[1] \n \n \n \n \nComponents o f Rainwater Harvesting System \nA Rain water harvesting system comprises of components for  \npipes or drains, filtration, and tanks for storage of harvested water.

MODEL DESCRIPTION  \n \nThe Description of the Case Study: \nThe campus of this institute is situated at the cen tre area of Aurangabad city. The institute is at \ncentre of the campus and surrounded by residential area. The residential accommodation is \nprovided to all faculty staff and students. The tot al strength of campus including students and \nstaff peoples is more 2000. Thus, with this present  strength and also with the expansion, campus \nshould also increase its facilities and maintenance  requirements. Thus water is most natural \nresource being always in high demands by human bein gs and is indispensable part of the life. \nHence, keeping in view all the above problems and s tatus of campus GEC, Aurangabad, \nadministrative body focussed on water scarcity prob lem. Therefore, in this situation, rain water \nharvesting system can be considered as a best solut ion for fighting against water scarcity in \ncampus. [2] \n \n\n4 \n \nProblem Formulation: \nDesign of rainwater harvesting system of GECA campu s using Geographic Information System \n(GIS). For this taking catchment area of campus fro m parking area, workshop area, some of the \nelectronics department area up to Hostel ‘A’. Demar cate and calculate area by using GIS. The \nslope of the catchment shall be checked by auto lev el. Analyse the potential of runoff from the \nrainfall from the catchment and suggest suitable re charge pit locations and also volume of \nrainwater to be recharge in the ground. What will b e the approximate expenditure for these \nrecharge pits. If the institute wants t",
    "nt and suggest suitable re charge pit locations and also volume of \nrainwater to be recharge in the ground. What will b e the approximate expenditure for these \nrecharge pits. If the institute wants to construct underground storage tank, what will be the \napproximate expenditure. \nDesign of RWH system: \nFor the proposed location in GECA campus, visual in spection, survey by Auto level and \nGeographic Information System (GIS) has been carriedout and required analysis is done. [3] \nFOR CATCHMENT 1: (Calculations are for 1 storm, considering intensit y of storm as 2 \ncm/hr)  \nCollected data – \n1. Catchment area  \n1. Rooftop area =4769 m2  \n2. Open area =10251 m2  \nAssume, \n 2. Average rainfall intensity =4 cm per 2 hr.  \n3. Runoff coefficient,  \nFor roof top area = 0.95  \nFor open area = 0.8  \n4. \n Storm duration = 2 hr.  \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nNow, by using rational formula,  \nFor roof top area,  \nQ = C.I.A /3.6  \n= 0.95 × 20 × 4769 × 10 \n-6 /3.6  \n= 0.02516 m3/sec  \nFor open area,  \nQ = C I A /3.6 \n = 0.8 × 20 × 10251 × 10 \n-6 /3.6  \n= 0.04556 m3 /sec  \nThus, Total runoff = 0.02516 + 0.04556  \n= 0.07072 m3/sec \nNow,  \nTotal runoff volume = peak runoff rate × storm duration \n=0.07072×2×3600  \n= 509.0184 m3  \n= 509018 lit. \nFor this volume of water, recharge pit of dimension s 10 m ×10 m ×1.5 m can be constructed. As \nthe topography of the area suggests the two locatio ns, one pit can be constructed beside boy’s \nhostel ‘A’, on the way of department of electronics .

CONCLUSION \nRecharge of ground water table is a gradual process , we can not suddenly increase the ground \nwater table after constructing recharge structures,  by constructing any type of recharge structure, \nand we can give our contribution in aquifer recharg e. This will help to rejuvenate the depleting \nground water resources. Also help to save the littl e amount of rain water which used to drain \naway from many years. Thus it is concluded that imp lementation of RWH system of \nGovernment College of Engineering Aurangabad (GECA)  campus would result in the form of \nthe best approach to deal with present scenario of water scarcity and storing huge quantity of \n53,96,816 litres in a year in college campus. \n \n \nVI.

The \naugmented resource can be harvested in the time of need.  Artificial recharge to \nground water is a process by which the ground water reservoir is augmented at \nrate exceeding that under natural conditions of replenishment. \n \n \n2.0 NEED  \n \n) To overcome the inadequacy of waters to meet our demands. \n) To arrest decline in ground water levels. \n) To enhance availability of ground water at specific place and time and utilize rain \nwater for sustainable development. \n) To increase infiltration of rain water in the subsoil which has decreased drastically \nin urban areas due to paving of open area. \n) To improve ground water quality by dilution. \n) To increase agriculture production. \n) To improve ecology of the area by increase in vegetation cover, etc. \n \n \n3.0 ADVANTAGES \n \n) Cost of recharge to sub-surface reservoir is lower than surface reservoirs. \n) The aquifer serves as distribution system also. \n) No land is wasted for storage purpose and no population displacement is involved. \n) Ground water is not directly exposed to evaporation an",

A few techniques of roof top rain water harvesting in urban \nareas are described below. \n \n(i) ROOF TOP RAIN WATER HARVESTING THROUGH RECHARGE PIT \n \n) In alluvial areas where permeable rock s are exposed on the land surface or at \nvery shallow depth, roof top rain water harvesting can be done through \nrecharge pits. \n) The technique is suitable for buildings having a roof area of 100 sq.m. and are \nconstructed for recharging the shallow aquifers. \n) Recharge Pits may be of any shape and size and are generally constructed 1 to \n2 m. wide and 2 to 3 . deep which are back filled with boulders (5-20 cm), \ngravels (5-10mm) and coarse sand (1.5- 2mm) in graded form. Boulders at the \nbottom, gravels in between and coarse sand at the top so that the silt content \nthat will come with runoff  will be deposited on",
    "s (5-10mm) and coarse sand (1.5- 2mm) in graded form. Boulders at the \nbottom, gravels in between and coarse sand at the top so that the silt content \nthat will come with runoff  will be deposited on the top of the coarse sand \nlayer and can easily be removed.  For smaller roof area, pit may be filled with \nbroken bricks/ cobbles. \n) A mesh should be provided at the roof so that leaves or any other solid waste / \ndebris is prevented from entering the pit and a desilting /collection chamber \nmay also be provided at the ground to arrest the flow of finer particles to the \nrecharge pit. \n) The top layer of sand should be cleaned periodically to maintain the recharge \nrate. \n) By-pass arrangement be provided before the collection chamber to reject the \nfirst showers. \n \n \n  \n \n(ii) punaBa-rNa Ka[- (T/Onca)  Wara Ct sao p`aPt vaYaa- jala ka saMcayana \n \n) punaBa-rNa Ka[- 200-300 vaga- maI0 xao~fla vaalaI Ct ko Bavana ko ilae ]pyau@t hO tqaa \njahaM BaoV str iCClao gahra[- maoM ]plabQa haota hao . \n) punaBa-rNa krnao yaaogya jala kI  ]plabQata ko AaQaar pr Ka[- 0.5 sao 1 maI0 caaOD,I, 1 sao   \n1.5 maI0 gahrI tqaa 10 sao 20 maI0 lambaI hao saktI hO . \n) yah iSalaaKND  5 sao 20 sao0maI0 ba jarI 5 10ima0maI0 evaM maaoTI rot 1.5-2 ima0maI0 sao \nk`maanausaar Bara haota hO . tla maoM iSalaaKND bajarI baIca maoM tqaa maaoTI rot sabasao }pr BarI \nhaotI hO taik Apvaah ko saaqa Aanao vaalaI gaad  maaoTI rot pr jamaa ha o jaae ijasao AasaanaI \nsao hTayaa jaa sako . \n) jaalaI Ct sa jala inaklanao vaalao pa[-p pr la gaa[- jaanaI caaihe taik p%taoM yaa Anya zaosa \npdaqaao-M kao Ka[- maoM jaanao sao raoka jaa sako eva saUx ma pdaqaao-M kao Ka[- maoM jaanao sao raoknao ko \nilae gaadinastarNa kxa ya saMga`hNa kxa jamaIna pr banaayaa jaanaa caaihe. \n) p`qama vaYaa- ko jala kao saMga`hNa kxa maoM jaanao  sao raoknao ko ilae kxa sao phlao ek ]pmaaga- \nvyavasqaa kI jaanaI caaihe . \n) punaBa-rNa dr kao banaae rKnao ko ilae rot kI }prI sath kI AavaiQak safa[- kI jaanaI \ncaaihe . \n \n \n \nBaUjala s",

The \nfirst roof runoff is let off through the bottom of drainpipe.  After closing the \nbottom pipe, the rainwater of subsequent rain showers is taken through a T to \nan online PVC filter.  The filter may be provided before water enters the \ntubewells.  The filter is 1 –1.2 m. in length and is made up of PVC pipe.  It’s \ndiameter should vary depending on the area of roof, 15 cm if roof area is less \nthan 150 sq m and 20 cm if the roof area is more.  The filter is provided with a \nreducer of 6.25 cm on both the sides.  Filter is divided into three chambers by \nPVC screens so that filter material is not mixed up.  The first chamber is filled \nup with gravel (6-10mm), middle chamber with pebbles (12-20 mm) and last \nchamber with bigger pebbles (20-40 mm). \n) If the roof area is more, a filter pit may be provided.  Rainwater from roofs is \ntaken to collection/desilting chambers located on ground.  These collection \nchambers are interconnected a",

These collection \nchambers are interconnected as well as connected to the filter pit through pipes \nhaving a slop of 1:15. The filter pit may vary in shape and size depending \nupon available runoff and are back-filled with graded material, boulder at the \nbottom, gravel in the middle and sand at the top with varying thickness (0.30-\n0.50m) and may be separated by screen.  The pit is divided into two chambers, \nfilter material in one chamber and other chamber is kept empty to \naccommodate excess filtered water and to monitor the quality of filtered water. \nA connecting pipe with recharge well is provided at the bottom of the pit for \nrecharging of filtered water through well. \n \n \n  \n \n(iv) punaBa-rNa k^uMAaoM ko saaqa Ka[- Wara Ct sao p`aPt vaYaa- jala ka saMcayana \n \n) eosao xao~aoM maoM jahaM sathI maRda Apargamya hO tqa AiQak maa~a maoM Ct sao p`aPt vaYaa- jala yaa sathI Apvaah \nkafI kma samayaantrala maoM BaarI vaYaa- ko karNa ]plabQa hao, eosao maoM Ka[-/ ipT maoM banao iflTr maaQyama maoM \njala saMga`hNa  ikyaa jaata hO tqaa ivaSaoYa  $p sao inaima-t punaBa-rNa ku^MAaoM ko Wara BaUima jala ka lagaatar  \npunaBa-rNa ikyaa jaata hO .  \n) yah tknaIk ]sa xao~ ko ilae AadSa-t : ]pyau@t hOM jaha^M pargamya str BaUima sath ko 3 maI0 ko Andr \nmaaOjaUd hO . \n) 100 sao 300 ima0 maI0 vyaasa ka punaBa-rNa ku^MAa ijasakI kma sao kma gahra[- jala str sao 3 sao 5 maI0 \nnaIcao tk hao banaayaa jaata hO . xao~ kI ilaqaaolaaojaI  ko Anausaar kUp saMrcanaa ka iDja,a[-na tOyaar ikyaa \njaata hO ijasamaoM CIClao va gahro jalaBaRt ko saamanao  iCd`yau@t pa[-p Dalaa jaata hO .  \n) punaBa-rNa ku^Me kao maQya mao rKto hue  jala kI ]plabQata pr AaQaairt 1.5 sao 3 maI0 caaOD,I tqaa 10 \nsao 30 maI0 lambaI paiSva-k Ka[- ka inamaa-Na ikyaa jaata hO. \n) Ka[- maoM kMu^AaoM kI saM#yaa  jala kI ]plabQata va xao~ ivaSaoYa maoM caT\\TanaaoM kI ]wva-",

Normally percolation tanks are designed for storage \ncapacity of 0.1 to 0.5 MCM.  It is necessary to design the tank to provide a \nponded water column generally between 3 & 4.5 m. \n) The percolation tanks are mostly earthen dams with masonry structure only for \nspillway.  The purpose of the percolation tanks is to recharge the ground water \nstorage and hence seepage below the seat of the bed is permissible.  For dams \nupto 4.5 m height, cut off trenches are not necessary and keying and benching \nbetween the dam seat and the natural ground is sufficient. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n \n(v) caOk DOma  / saImaonT Plaga /  naalaa baMD ko Wara vaYaa- jala saMcayana  \n \n) caOk DOma  ka inamaa-Na Aitsaamaanya  Zlaana vaalaI CaoTI ja",

    "recharge of stored water within short span of time. \n) The water stored in these structures is mostly confined to stream course and \nthe height is normally less than 2 m and excess water is allowed to flow over \nthe wall. In order to avoid scouring from excess run off, water cushions are \nprovided at downstream side. \n) To harness the maximum run off in the stream, series of such check dams can \nbe constructed to have recharge on regional scale. \n) Clay filled cement bags arranged as a wall are also being successfully used as \na barrier across small nalas.  At places, shallow trench is excavated across the \nnala and asbestos sheets are put on two sides.  The space between the rows of \nasbestos sheets across the nala is backfilled with clay.  Thus a low cost check \ndam is created.  On the upstream side clay filled cement bags can be stacked in \na slope to provide stability to the structure.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(vi) punaBa-rNa SaaFT Wara va vaYaa- jala saMcayana \n \n) Apir$wjalaBaRt ijasako }pr kma pargamya str hao ko punaBa-rNa ko ilae sabasao ]pyau@t va kma laagat \nvaalaI tknaIk hO . \n) Agar str nahIM Zhnao vaalI p`vaRit ka hao tao punaBa-rNa  SaaFt ka inamaa-Na haqaa oM sao ikyaa jaa sakta hO . \nSaaFT ka vyaasa saamaanyat: 2 maI0 sao AiQak haota hO . \n) SaaFT ka AMitma isara }prI Apar gamya str ko naIcao AiQak pargam ya str maoM haonaa caaihe. yah \nAavaSyak nahIM kI SaFT jalastr kao CUta hao . \n) ApMi@tbaw  (Analaa[nD) SaaFT maoM phlao baaolDr / pObala ifr bajarI  va Ant maoM maaoTI rot BarI jaanaI \ncaaihe . \n) yaid SaaFT laa[-nD hao tao punaBa-irt jala kao if lTr tk phu^Mcaanao vaalao ek CaoTo caalak pa[-p   \n(knD@Tr pa[-p)  ko maaQyama sao SaaFT maoM Dalaa jaata hO . \n) [sa trh kI punaBa-rNa saMrcan aaeoM ga`amaINa  TOMkao  ko ilae kafI laaBap`d haotI hOM jahaM iCClaI  icaknaI \nimaT\\TI kI prt jala ko jalaBaRt maoM irsaava haonao maoM baaQak haotI hO . \n) eosaa doKa gayaa hO ik barsaa t ko maaOsama maoM gaa^MvaaoM ko TOMk pUrI tr h sao Baro haoto hOM laoikna",

The \ndiameter of shaft is normally more than 2 m. \n) The shaft should end in more permeable strata below the top impermeable \nstrata.  It may not touch water table.  \n) The unlined shaft should be backfilled, initially with boulders/ cobbles \nfollowed by gravel and coarse sand. \n) In case of lined shaft the recharge water may be fed through a smaller \nconductor pipe reaching up to the filter pack. \n) These recharge str",
    "h boulders/ cobbles \nfollowed by gravel and coarse sand. \n) In case of lined shaft the recharge water may be fed through a smaller \nconductor pipe reaching up to the filter pack. \n) These recharge structures are very useful for village ponds where shallow clay \nlayer impedes the infiltration of water to the aquifer. \n) It is seen that in rainy season village tanks are fully filled up but water from \nthese tanks does not percolate down due to siltation and tubewell and dugwells \nlocated nearby remains dried up.  The water from village tanks get evaporated \nand is not available for the beneficial use. \n) By constructing recharge shaft in tanks, surplus water can be recharged to \nground water. Recharge shafts of 0.5 to 3 m.  diameter and 10 to 15 m.  deep \nare constructed depending upon availability of quantum of water.  The top of \nshaft is kept above the tank bed level pref erably at half of full supply level.  \nThese are back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. \n) In upper portion of 1 or 2 m depth, the brick masonry work is carried out for \nthe stability of the structure.  \n) Through this technique all the accumulated water in village tank above 50% \nfull supply level would be recharged to ground water.

A campaign “Catch The Rain” with the tag line “Catch the rain,\nwhere it falls, when it falls” was implemented in 2020 to nudge the states and\nall stakeholders to create Rain Water Harvesting Structures (RWHS). In\n2021, “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” was launched by Hon'ble Prime\nMinister subsuming Catch the Rain (CTR) campaign to cover all the blocks of\nall districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country. JSA: CTR has\nbecome an annual feature since 2021. JSA: CTR 2023 with the\ntheme “Source Sustainability for Drinking Water” was implemented across\nthe country. Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain – 2024 with the theme \"Nari\nShakti se Jal Shakti\" has been started emphasizing the pivotal role played by\nwomen in the ﬁeld of water conservation.

    "Rainwater harvesting systems to come up for rapid\nrail corridor\nGhaziabad: NCRTC has developed 900 rainwater harvesting systems throughout 70km of the\nelevated section of the rapid rail corridor to tap rainwater for groundwater recharge. This will help\nconserve over 70 lakh litres of rainwater.The viaduct and roof of the stations are the catchment area\nfor the rainwater.\"About 900 rainwater harvesting structures or recharge pits have been constructed\nfrom Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut. About 70km of the 82-km-long Namo Bharat\nCorridor is elevated, and the rest is underground. In the elevated part of the corridor, rainwater\nharvesting pits have been built in the road divider section below the viaduct span,\" said an official\nfrom NCRTC.\"Each pit constructed at the stations is 2 metres in diameter and 2.5 metres deep,\nwith a capacity to collect approximately 6,500 litres of rainwater. Meanwhile, the pits built beneath\nthe viaduct measure 2.9 x 1.5 metres in size, with a depth of 1.5 metres, and can store about 8,700\nlitres of water each and together about 70 lakh litres of rainwater,\" added the official.You Can Also\nCheck:Noida AQI|Weather in Noida|Bank Holidays in Noida|Public Holidays in NoidaAs part of the\ndesign, rainwater harvesting pits are constructed at intervals of one span under the viaduct.Two\nsmall water chambers are built opposite each other near the pillars at ground level and connected\nto the viaduct through pipes.The harvesting pit is located between these two chambers, connected\nto them through pipes.During rainfall, water from the viaduct flows into the two chambers and then\npercolates into the ground through the harvesting pit. To ensure the rainwater is filtered before\nabsorption, each pit is equipped with a three-layer filtration system comprising gravel and sand.In\naddition to these two depots, two ponds measuring 1,160 square metres and 663 square metres\nrespectively have also been constructed near Duhai depot.\"These ponds, with",
